On August 30, 2016, the European Commission (the &#8220;Commission&#8221;) announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to Apple Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the &#8220;State Aid Decision&#8221;). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the &#8220;General Court&#8221;). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court&#8217;s decision to the European Court of Justice (the &#8220;ECJ&#8221;) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023.

&#160;

On September 10, 2024, the ECJ announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the General Court and confirmed the Commission&#8217;s 2016 State Aid Decision. As a result, the Company expects to record a one-time income tax charge in its fourth fiscal quarter ending September 28, 2024, of up to approximately $10 billion, which will increase the Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for the quarter.

&#160;

The information presented in this Current Report is preliminary and actual results may differ when the Company reports its final results for the fourth quarter.

As disclosed in the Original Filing, the Company detected that beginning in late November 2023, a nation-state threat actor had gained access to and exfiltrated information from a very small percentage of employee email accounts including members of our senior leadership team and employees in our cybersecurity, legal, and other functions. Since the date of the Original Filing, the Company has determined that the threat actor used and continues to use information it obtained to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access to some of the Company&#8217;s source code repositories and internal systems. The threat actor&#8217;s ongoing attack is characterized by a sustained, significant commitment of the threat actor&#8217;s resources, coordination, and focus. Our active investigations of the threat actor&#8217;s activities are ongoing, findings of our investigations will continue to evolve, and further unauthorized access may occur.

We have increased our security investments, cross-enterprise coordination and mobilization, and have enhanced our ability to defend ourselves and secure and harden our environment against this advanced persistent threat. We continue to coordinate with federal law enforcement with respect to its ongoing investigation of the threat actor and the incident.

As of the date of this filing, the incident has not had a material impact on the Company&#8217;s operations. The Company has not yet determined that the incident is reasonably likely to materially impact the Company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations.

This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, which are any predictions, projections or other statements about future events based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and the Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in the Company&#8217;s expectations.

On January 12, 2024, Microsoft (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;) detected that beginning in late November 2023, a nation-state associated threat actor had gained access to and exfiltrated information from a very small percentage of employee email accounts including members of our senior leadership team and employees in our cybersecurity, legal, and other functions, on the basis of preliminary analysis. We were able to remove the threat actor&#8217;s access to the email accounts on or about January 13, 2024. We are examining the information accessed to determine the impact of the incident. We also continue to investigate the extent of the incident. We have notified and are working with law enforcement. We are also notifying relevant regulatory authorities with respect to unauthorized access to personal information. As of the date of this filing, the incident has not had a material impact on the Company&#8217;s operations. The Company has not yet determined whether the incident is reasonably likely to materially impact the Company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations.

This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, which are any predictions, projections or other statements about future events based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and the Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in the Company&#8217;s expectations."

On October 13, 2023, Microsoft Corporation, a Washington corporation (&#8220;Microsoft&#8221;), completed its previously announced acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Activision Blizzard&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), dated as of January 18, 2022, by and among Microsoft, Activision Blizzard and Anchorage Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), at the effective time of the Merger (the &#8220;Effective Time&#8221;), Merger Sub merged with and into Activision Blizzard (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), with Activision Blizzard surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft.

At the Effective Time, each share of Activision Blizzard common stock, par value $0.000001 per share (the &#8220;Activision Blizzard Common Stock&#8221;), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Activision Blizzard Common Stock (i) held by Activision Blizzard as treasury stock (excluding certain shares of Activision Blizzard Common Stock held by a wholly owned subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, which shares remained outstanding and unaffected by the Merger), (ii) owned by Microsoft or Merger Sub, (iii) owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft or Merger Sub or (iv) held by Activision Blizzard stockholders who neither voted in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who had properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Activision Blizzard Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time), was cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $95.00 in cash (the &#8220;Per Share Amount&#8221;), without interest.

In addition, at the Effective Time, subject to certain exceptions, unvested Activision Blizzard options and stock-based awards were assumed by Microsoft and converted into corresponding awards that are subject to shares of Microsoft common stock. Vested Activision Blizzard options and stock-based awards were cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Per Share Amount for each share of Activision Blizzard Common Stock underlying such awards (or, in the case of such options, the difference (if any) between the Per Share Amount and the applicable exercise price), less any applicable tax withholdings."

On October 11, 2023, Microsoft Corporation announced the receipt of Notices of Proposed Adjustment (&#8220;NOPAs&#8221;) from the Internal Revenue Service (the &#8220;IRS&#8221;) for the tax years 2004 to 2013. The NOPAs were received on September 26, 2023. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of September 30, 2023, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS&#8217;s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.

This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, which are any predictions, projections or other statements about future events based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and Microsoft undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in the company&#8217;s expectations."

Today, the Company announced its acquisition of Laminar, Inc. As a result of the acquisition, Johnson &#38; Johnson will be adjusting its expected Adjusted Fiscal Year 2023 EPS. The asset acquisition will require an in-process research and development charge which will reduce operational and reported Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.17 from guidance previously issued. The new expected operational and reported Adjusted EPS ranges are now $9.85 to $9.91 and $9.90 to $9.96, respectively. Additionally, the asset acquisition is expected to have an approximate negative $0.15 EPS impact in fiscal year 2024. 

The Company&#8217;s press release announcing the acquisition is attached to this Report as Exhibit 99.1. 

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding the acquisition of Laminar, Inc. and its expected effect on our financial results. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations of future events. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our current expectations and projections. A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in Johnson &#38; Johnson&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, including in the sections captioned &#8220;Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; and &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; and in Johnson &#38; Johnson&#8217;s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of these filings are available online at www.sec.gov, www.jnj.com or on request from Johnson &#38; Johnson. Any forward-looking statement made in this release speaks only as of the date of this release. Johnson &#38; Johnson does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information or future events or developments. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This Current Report on Form 8-K includes Adjusted EPS, which represents a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure enhances the Company&#8217;s and investors&#8217; understanding of our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company&#8217;s definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EPS is earnings per share, or EPS. The Company is not providing a reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to EPS, however, because Johnson &#38; Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis as the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of adjusted items, such as legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, and purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson &#38; Johnson's results computed in accordance with GAAP."

On November 21, 2023, the Compensation &#38; Benefits Committee (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) of the Board of Directors of Johnson &#38; Johnson (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) approved the adoption of the Johnson &#38; Johnson Deferred Compensation Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;). The Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides eligible management and other highly-compensated employees (including named executive officers) with the opportunity to defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 50% of their base salary and up to 100% of their annual cash performance bonus to be earned in the following year. Participants will be fully vested at all times in their account within the Plan. The Plan does not provide for matching or discretionary Company contributions. Payments of deferred amounts, together with deemed investment return (positive or negative), will generally be made following a participant&#8217;s separation from service with the Company or at an earlier in-service payment date elected by the participant. 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated into this Current Report on Form 8-K by reference. 

In connection with the adoption of the Plan, the Committee also approved the following modifications to the Johnson &#38; Johnson Executive Income Deferral Plan (the &#8220;EIDP&#8221;): after the date of adoption of the Plan, no further initial deferral elections may be made under the EIDP; subject to compliance with applicable tax rules, EIDP participants may change the time and/or form of payment of their EIDP account balances to those available under the Plan; and the notional investment alternatives under the Plan will also apply to amounts deferred under the EIDP.

The blackout period will be imposed if fifty percent or more of the participants or beneficiaries in the Johnson &#38; Johnson Savings Plan, Johnson &#38; Johnson Retirement Savings Plan and any other &#8220;individual account plan&#8221;, as defined in Regulation BTR (collectively, the &#8220;Plans&#8221;) direct the trustee for the applicable Plan (or its designated agent) to exchange some or all of the Johnson &#38; Johnson Shares held in the Johnson &#38; Johnson Stock Fund (through which participants may invest a portion of their Plan account balance in Johnson &#38; Johnson Shares) attributable to their Plan accounts. The reason for the potential blackout period is that participants in the Plans who tender their Johnson &#38; Johnson Shares will be unable, during a short period of time, to exchange or withdraw their account balances in the Johnson &#38; Johnson Stock Fund or take certain other actions. 

Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation BTR (i.e., the Blackout Trading Restriction), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, generally impose certain restrictions on trading in company securities by directors and executive officers in the event that fifty percent or more of an issuer&#8217;s plan participants are so restricted. During the blackout (if it occurs), subject to certain limited exemptions, directors and executive officers will be prohibited from directly or indirectly purchasing, selling, acquiring or transferring any Johnson &#38; Johnson Shares or derivative securities with respect to Johnson &#38; Johnson Shares acquired in connection with their service or employment as a director or executive officer of Johnson &#38; Johnson, except that directors and executive officers will have the opportunity to exchange Johnson &#38; Johnson Shares in the Offer. The blackout for the Johnson &#38; Johnson Stock Fund (if it occurs) is expected to begin on August 15, 2023 at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time and to continue through the week of August 28, 2023 (assuming no extension of the Offer). 

During the blackout and for up to two years following the ending date of the blackout, shareholders or other interested parties may obtain, without charge, the actual beginning and ending dates of the blackout. Any inquiries regarding the blackout may be directed to:

The CVR Agreement requires Johnson &#38; Johnson to, with respect to each of (a) the STEMI Recommendation Milestone and the FDA Approval Milestone, (b) the HRPCI Milestone and (c) the Cardiogenic Shock Milestone, expend at least $37,682,000, $81,495,200 and $39,800,000, respectively, towards the achievement of such Milestone(s), subject to certain exceptions specified in the CVR Agreement. Other than with respect to these commitments, Johnson &#38; Johnson (i) has the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to direct and control the development, marketing, commercialization and sale of the Products in all respects and (ii) is not otherwise required (expressly or implicitly) to achieve or undertake any level of efforts, or employ any level of resources, to develop, market, commercialize or sell the Products or achieve the Milestones. 

It is possible that none of the Milestones will be achieved, in which case holders of CVRs will not receive any payments with respect to their CVRs. It is not possible to predict whether any payment will become payable with respect to the CVRs. Whether any Milestone required for payment of any Milestone Payment is met will depend on many factors, some of which are outside the control of Johnson &#38; Johnson and its subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that any of the Milestones will be achieved or that any payment with respect to the CVRs will be made. 

The foregoing description of the CVR Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the CVR Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference."

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on November 15, 2022, Purchaser commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding Shares at a price of (a) $380.00 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes (the &#8220; Cash Amount &#8221;), plus (b) one non-tradeable contractual contingent value right per Share (each, a &#8220; CVR &#8221;), which CVR represents the right to receive contingent payments of up to $35.00 per Share in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of the Milestones (the Cash Amount plus one CVR, collectively, the &#8220; Offer Price &#8221;), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated November 15, 2022 (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the &#8220; Offer to Purchase &#8221;) and in the related Letter of Transmittal (together with the Offer to Purchase and other related materials, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the &#8220; Offer &#8221;). 

On December 22, 2022, Johnson &#38; Johnson announced that the Offer had expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on December 21, 2022 (the &#8220; Expiration Time &#8221;) and that as of such time, based on the information provided by the depositary for the Offer, 25,759,195 Shares were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, representing approximately 57.1% of the then-outstanding Shares, which Shares were sufficient to have met the Minimum Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Offer and to enable the Merger (as defined below) to occur in accordance with Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220; DGCL &#8221;) without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement by ABIOMED stockholders. All conditions to the Offer having been satisfied, Purchaser subsequently irrevocably accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time, and will promptly pay for such Shares pursuant to the Offer. 

Following the completion of the Offer, on December 22, 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, Purchaser merged with and into ABIOMED (the &#8220; Merger &#8221;), with ABIOMED continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and thereby becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson &#38; Johnson. At the closing of the Merger, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the &#8220; Effective Time &#8221;) (other than (a) Shares owned by Johnson &#38; Johnson, Purchaser or ABIOMED (or held in ABIOMED&#8217;s treasury), or by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson &#38; Johnson or Purchaser, in each case at the commencement of the Offer and immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) Shares irrevocably accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer or (c) Shares owned by any stockholders who have properly and validly demanded their appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL) was converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest and less any required withholding taxes. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time: 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; each stock option to purchase Shares (an &#8220; ABIOMED Option &#8221;) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price that is less than the Cash Amount (an &#8220; In-the-Money Option &#8221;) was canceled in exchange for the Cash Amount (less the applicable exercise price) plus one CVR, in each case, multiplied by the number of Shares underlying such In-the-Money Option; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; each ABIOMED Option outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Cash Amount (an &#8220; Out-of-the-Money Option &#8221;) was canceled in exchange for the right to receive cash payments equal to the total amount of the Milestone Payments actually payable in connection with a CVR (if any), less the amount by which such exercise price exceeds the Cash Amount (if any), multiplied by the number of Shares underlying such Out-of-the-Money Option; 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; each performance stock unit in respect of Shares (an &#8220; ABIOMED PSU &#8221;) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was canceled in exchange for the Cash Amount plus one CVR, in each case, multiplied by the number of Shares underlying such ABIOMED PSU, generally determined based on actual performance for any performance periods that have been completed as of the Effective Time and maximum performance for all other performance periods; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; each restricted stock unit in respect of Shares (an &#8220; ABIOMED RSU &#8221;) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was canceled in exchange for the Cash Amount plus one CVR, in each case, multiplied by the number of Shares underlying such ABIOMED RSU. 

The aggregate amount paid by Purchaser in the Offer and the Merger for the Shares was approximately $17.1 billion, excluding related fees and expenses. Johnson &#38; Johnson and Purchaser funded the acquisition of the Shares in the Offer and the Merger through a combination of Johnson &#38; Johnson&#8217;s available cash on hand and short-term financing. Johnson &#38; Johnson estimates that it would need approximately $1.6 billion to pay the maximum aggregate amount that the holders of CVRs and holders of certain options would be entitled to if all of the Milestones are achieved. 

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the related transactions does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Johnson &#38; Johnson on November 1, 2022 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company is working tirelessly to restore affected services and resume normal operations and along with law enforcement is investigating the extent of impacted data. The Company continues to believe the issue is specific to Change Healthcare. All other systems across the Company are operational. 

The progress the Company is making, including interim measures and an expected timeline for restoration of key Change Healthcare systems, is described in a press release which the Company issued on March 7, 2024, a copy of which is attached to the Amendment as Exhibit 99.1.

Effective June 1, 2024, JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (&#8220;JPMorgan Financial&#8221;) became a direct subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase&#8221;) and all obligations owed to JPMorgan Financial by other subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase under its intercompany agreements became obligations of JPMorgan Chase. 

&#160;

As a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase, JPMorgan Financial has no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of its securities and the collection of intercompany obligations. Aside from the initial capital contribution from JPMorgan Chase, substantially all of JPMorgan Financial&#8217;s assets relate to obligations of JPMorgan Chase to make payments under loans made to JPMorgan Chase by JPMorgan Financial or under other intercompany agreements. As a result, JPMorgan Financial is dependent upon payments from JPMorgan Chase to meet its obligations under its securities. If JPMorgan Chase does not make payments to JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Financial is unable to make payments on its securities, holders of JPMorgan Financial securities may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by JPMorgan Chase, and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase.

JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) announced that the independent members of the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) approved the annual compensation for 2023 for Mr. James Dimon, CEO, in the amount of $36,000,000, compared to last year&#8217;s annual compensation of $34,500,000. The annual compensation for 2023 reflects Mr. Dimon&#8217;s stewardship of the Firm, with growth across all of its market leading lines of business, record financial results and a fortress balance sheet. In addition, the Firm successfully navigated and supported its clients and customers through the regional bank turmoil as well as completed the acquisition of First Republic. 

Mr. Dimon&#8217;s total compensation includes an annual base salary of $1,500,000 and performance-based variable incentive compensation of $34,500,000. $5,000,000 of the variable incentive compensation will be delivered in cash and the remaining $29,500,000 will be delivered in the form of at-risk Performance Share Units (""PSUs""). PSUs tie 100% of Mr. Dimon&#8217;s annual equity-based compensation to ongoing performance metrics, representing 86% of his total variable incentive compensation. The key features of the PSU program are structurally consistent with last year, including the financial metric (return on tangible common equity 1 - ""ROTCE"") with absolute and relative performance goals, payout levels, vesting and hold requirements, as well as clawback and recovery provisions 2 . 

Amid the significant challenges of the regional bank turmoil, ongoing, growing geopolitical tensions, global economic uncertainty, and elevated inflation and higher rates, under Mr. Dimon's stewardship, the Firm continued to serve its clients and customers around the world to advance economic growth, while investing in and executing on long-term strategic initiatives. The Firm&#8217;s businesses saw continued momentum during 2023, demonstrating the power of its years of investments and the value of its consistency and fortress principles. In 2023, the Firm reported record revenue for the 6 th consecutive year of $162.4 billion 1 and net income of $49.6 billion, or $16.23 per share, with ROTCE of 21%. The Firm increased its quarterly common dividend from $1.00 to $1.05 per share and continued to reinforce its fortress balance sheet. 

The Firm ended the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.0%, CET1 capital of $250.6 billion and $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities, providing it with meaningful capacity to support clients and further invest in its business and communities. During 2023, the Firm raised over $2.3 trillion 3 of credit and capital for its consumer and institutional clients around the world, which includes individuals, homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries in all regions of the world. The Firm continued its investments in technology, people, systems and products, as well as its steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, including helping to create a stronger, more inclusive economy and advance cities and neighborhoods around the world, positioning the Firm for future success. 

As part of determining Mr. Dimon&#8217;s compensation, the Board considered his holistic performance across financial and non-financial performance dimensions, including his continued exemplary leadership of the Firm which continues to be one of the largest financial services firms in the world and is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers, predominantly in the United States, and many of the world&#8217;s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients globally. 

The Board continues to recognize that the Firm is in a uniquely fortunate position to be led by such a highly talented and experienced executive who continues to grow the company, maintain market leadership positions, strengthen the Firm&#8217;s reputation, invest in opportunities for the future, promote diversity and best practices, manage risk and develop great leaders, while also maintaining his focus on the Firm&#8217;s clients. 

1 Revenue is on a managed basis. Managed revenue and ROTCE are non-GAAP financial measures. For further discussion, see notes (a) and (b) on page 6 of Exhibit 99.1 to the Firm&#8217;s Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 12, 2024, which has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, containing the Firm's earnings press release for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. 

2 Equity incentives are subject to the JPMorgan Chase Bonus Recoupment Policy which applies in the event of a material restatement of the Firm's financial results as well as the Policy for the Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation. In addition, all equity awards granted in 2024 contain recapture provisions that enable the Firm to cancel outstanding awards and/or recover the value of certain stock distributed under the award in specified circumstances. In addition to recapture provisions, portions of equity awards awarded to the CEO are also subject to additional Protection-based Vesting provisions under which awards may be cancelled as determined by the Compensation &#38; Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by the Board of Directors. 

3 Credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments."

Bank of America Corporation (&#8220;Bank of America&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) today announced that its Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) approved 2023 total compensation for Chair and Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan of $29,000,000, compared to 2022 total compensation of $30,000,000. 

In determining this compensation, the independent members of the Board evaluated many aspects of the Company&#8217;s performance and Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s leadership in delivering Responsible Growth once again in 2023. The Board acknowledged the Company&#8217;s continued success in 2023 and Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s leadership under this operating model particularly in this period of considerable economic uncertainty. 

Shareholders. The Company earned $26.5 billion in net income in 2023, a decrease of 4% from 2022. As the Company reported in its latest earnings release on January 12, 2024, those full year results included two notable items related to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation special assessment ($2.1 billion pre-tax) and the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index cessation-related charge ($1.6 billion pre-tax) incurred in the fourth quarter totaling $3.7 billion pre-tax, or $2.8 billion after-tax. Excluding these notable items net income was $29.3 billion, an increase of 6% over 2022. Excluding these two notable items provides additional information for evaluating the Company&#8217;s results of operations and comparing its operational performance between periods because these impacts may not be reflective of the Company&#8217;s underlying operating performance. These results were aided by strong organic growth, while showing diligent expense management. The Company&#8217;s balance sheet remained a source of strength, with approximately $292 billion in shareholders&#8217; equity and liquidity levels of $897 billion at the end of 2023. Book value per share improved 9% during 2023, as well. The strength of the balance sheet allowed the Company to support clients and continue to invest in the future of the Company. It also allowed the Company to return $12 billion to shareholders in 2023, through dividends and common stock repurchases. The Company&#8217;s common stock price improved modestly from year-end 2022, while the KBW Bank Index declined 5%. 

Employees. The Company continued to invest in being a great place to work in 2023. The Company raised the minimum hourly rate of pay for U.S. teammates to $23/hour continuing its commitment to increase that rate to $25/hour by 2025. Benefits offered by Bank of America included continued support for childcare reimbursement and back-up care programs, as well as elder care. The Company also further enhanced its emotional health wellness programs, and beginning in 2023, teammates celebrating at least 15 years of continuous service with the Company may participate in a new sabbatical program. Additionally, the Company recently announced the seventh year of Sharing Success awards since 2017, with approximately 97% of employees receiving an award. The majority of these employees will receive shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, further aligning their interests with shareholders. 

Clients. The Company continued to support clients in 2023 with credit, capital and liquidity. This helped us to report approximately $8 billion in loan growth to more than $1.05 trillion. With regard to Consumer and Wealth Management, we were entrusted by clients to manage $5.4 trillion in balances across loans, deposits and investment balances. In total we saw approximately $84 billion in wealth flows in 2023. Importantly, the Company experienced organic growth across all its businesses and was a source of strength in times of stress in the industry this year. In 2023, the Company added more than 600,000 net new consumer checking accounts, with Consumer investment accounts growing to more than 3.8 million. The Company&#8217;s Wealth Management businesses added a record 40,000 net new relationships in 2023, and added nearly 150,000 new bank accounts for investment clients in 2023. Additionally, Global Markets achieved its highest sales and trading revenue in a decade. Global Banking teams added 2,500 new clients in 2023, which is twice as many as they added in 2022. The Company also continued to see strong client adoption and engagement across its digital platforms in 2023, resulting in industry leading accolades and awards for best digital platform in a number of areas. For example, Euromoney magazine recognized Bank of America as the World&#8217;s Best Bank for Digital. 

Communities . The Company continued to share success with the communities it serves. The Company provided nearly $290 million in philanthropic investments to help drive economic mobility, including $56 million for basic needs. The Company continued to deliver on its commitment to help entrepreneurs thrive, driving economic opportunity and investment in its communities. The Company&#8217;s current $550+ million portfolio of 160 smaller, local venture capital/private equity funds is invested in small businesses in markets around the U.S. Additionally, over the course of 2023, employees gave more than 2.4 million volunteer hours and directed more than $82 million in combined individual giving and the Company&#8217;s matching gifts, volunteer grants and other employee-directed giving programs. 

Compensation Structure . The Board determined that Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s compensation structure continues to be composed of base salary, time-based restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;), and performance RSUs. Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s annual base salary remains $1.5 million. The aggregate value of his 2023 equity incentive awarded by the Board is $27.5 million. Consistent with prior years, there is no cash bonus. The incentive is comprised 30% of cash-settled RSUs that will vest over the next 12 months, 20% of stock-settled RSUs that will vest annually over the next four years, and 50% of performance RSUs that will be re-earned only if Bank of America&#8217;s future financial performance meets specific standards. 

The overall structure of Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s 2023 performance RSUs remains consistent with the structure over the prior 11 years. The performance RSUs awarded to Mr. Moynihan continue to use a &#8220;re-earn&#8221; approach, vesting only if the Company meets specific performance standards over a three-year period (from 2024 through 2026). Under this &#8220;re-earn&#8221; approach, future performance of the Company below the standards of the performance RSUs will decrease the amount ultimately paid; 100% is the maximum payout if standards are met. The three-year average return on assets and three-year average growth in adjusted tangible book value standards for the performance RSUs are unchanged from last year. 

Additionally, all of Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s 2023 equity incentive awards are subject to the Company&#8217;s stock ownership and retention requirements. Specifically, 50% of the net after-tax shares he receives from equity awards must be retained until one year after his retirement. These equity awards also are subject to the Company&#8217;s cancellation and clawback policies."

As part of the global transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate as a benchmark rate, various alternative reference rates were established, including the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (&#8220;BSBY&#8221;) and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;). Beginning in 2021, Bank of America Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) and other members of the banking industry began utilizing these rates in various lending agreements, including commercial loans. 

On November 15, 2023, the Bloomberg Index Services Limited announced that the permanent cessation of BSBY and all its tenors will be effective on November 15, 2024. After such announcement, and following the Corporation&#8217;s internal and external consultations, it was determined that the accounting transition relief in ASC 848, Reference Rate Reform , is not available for BSBY cessation . 

Accordingly, under U.S. GAAP, the Corporation was required to &#8220;de-designate&#8221; certain interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedges of certain BSBY-indexe d loans, as of November 15, 2023, and reclassify into earnings any amounts recognized in the accumulated other comprehensive income category of shareholders&#8217; equity that relate to forecasted cash flows that are now no longer expected to occur. Therefore, the Corporation recognized a net non-cash, pretax charge of approximately $ 1.6 billion in the quarter ending December 31, 2023 (the &#8220;Charge&#8221;) presented in revenue through market making and similar activities . The $1.6 billion net impact is expected to be recognized back into the Corporation&#8217;s interest income in subsequent periods largely through 2026. The impact of such accounting treatment is solely due to the expectation that interest payments on the BSBY-indexed loans will change to SOFR, which is expected to have a nominal impact to the economics of these loans. The Charge reduced the Corporation&#8217;s common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by eight basis points, as of December 31, 2023 . 

The Corporation will report its fourth-quarter 2023 financial results on Friday, January 12, 2024 .

(e) On April 25, 2023, Bank of America Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) held its 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the &#8220;Annual Meeting&#8221;).

Bank of America Corporation (&#8220;Bank of America&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) today announced that its Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) has approved 2022 total compensation for Chair and Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan of $30,000,000, compared to 2021 total compensation of $32,000,000. 

In determining this compensation, the independent members of the Board evaluated many aspects of the Company&#8217;s performance in delivering Responsible Growth in 2022. 

The tenets of Responsible Growth encompass each aspect of Bank of America&#8217;s financial performance/shareholder return and its continued support of clients, communities and its employees. The Board acknowledged the Company&#8217;s continued success in 2022 and Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s leadership under this operating model particularly in this period of considerable economic uncertainty. 

Shareholders. The Company earned $27.5 billion in net income in 2022. Revenue growth of 7% from 2021 outpaced expense growth and created 400 bps of operating leverage. This was the third highest net income performance in the Company&#8217;s history. The Company returned $12 billion to shareholders in 2022 through dividends and common stock repurchases. The Company&#8217;s balance sheet remained a source of strength, with more than $273 billion in shareholders&#8217; equity and liquidity levels of $881 billion at the end of 2022. The Company&#8217;s common stock price declined 26% in 2022, consistent with the KBW Bank Index, reflecting weakened investor sentiment given geopolitical tensions and recessionary fears. 

Employees. The Company continued to invest in being a great place to work in 2022. The Company raised the minimum hourly rate of pay for U.S. teammates to $22/hour continuing its commitment to increase that rate to $25/hour by 2025. Enhanced benefits offered by Bank of America included continued support for childcare reimbursement and back-up care programs, as well as elder care. The Company also further enhanced its mental health wellness programs and launched a new sabbatical program for employees celebrating certain career milestones, starting at 15 years of service, beginning in 2023. Additionally, the Company recently announced the sixth year of Sharing Success awards since 2017 with approximately 96% of employees receiving an award, the majority will receive shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, further aligning interests with shareholders. 

Clients. The Company continued to support clients in 2022 with credit, capital and liquidity. The Company raised more than $700 billion of capital on behalf of clients, as well as increased new commercial commitments by more than $300 billion. This drove loan growth of more than $66 billion in 2022. Importantly, the Company experienced organic growth across its businesses. In 2022 the Company added more than one million net new consumer checking accounts with Consumer investment accounts growing to 3.5 million. The Company&#8217;s wealth management businesses added nearly 28,000 net new relationships in 2022 and added nearly 120,000 new bank accounts for investment clients in 2022. Additionally, Global Markets achieved its highest sales and trading revenue in a decade. The Company also continued to see strong client engagement across its digital platforms adding nearly three million active digital banking users in 2022, growing to 44 million. 

Communities . The Company continued to share success with the communities it serves. The Company provided more than $350 million in philanthropic investments to drive economic mobility, including $94 million for basic needs like hunger relief. The Company continued to deliver on its commitment to help diverse entrepreneurs thrive, ultimately driving economic opportunity and investment in its communities. The Company&#8217;s current $430+ million portfolio of more than 130 funds will ultimately invest in more than 2,000 minority- and women-led companies over the next five years. Additionally, over the course of 2022, employees gave nearly two million volunteer hours and directed more than $68 million in combined individual giving and the Company&#8217;s matching gifts, volunteer grants and other employee-directed giving programs. 

The Company was recognized in 2022 as the World&#8217;s Best Bank by Euromoney . 

Compensation Structure . The Board determined that Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s compensation structure continues to be composed of base salary, time-based restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;), and performance RSUs. Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s annual base salary remains $1.5 million. The aggregate value of his 2022 equity incentive awarded by the Board is $28.5 million. Consistent with prior years, there is no cash bonus. The incentive is comprised 30% of cash-settled RSUs that will vest over the next 12 months, 20% of stock-settled RSUs that will vest annually over the next four years, and 50% of performance RSUs that will be re-earned only if Bank of America&#8217;s future financial performance meets specific standards. 

The overall structure of Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s 2022 performance RSUs remains consistent with the structure over the prior 10 years, during which time shareholders voted to approve the Company&#8217;s executive compensation program through the annual advisory &#8220;Say on Pay&#8221; process with an average of 94.5% support. The performance RSUs awarded to Mr. Moynihan continue to use a 

&#8220;re-earn&#8221; approach, vesting only if the Company meets specific performance standards over a three-year period (from 2023 through 2025). Under this &#8220;re-earn&#8221; approach, future performance of the Company below the standards of the performance RSUs will decrease the amount ultimately paid; 100% is the maximum payout if standards are met. The three-year average return on assets and three-year average growth in adjusted tangible book value standards for the performance RSUs are unchanged from last year. 

Additionally, all of Mr. Moynihan&#8217;s 2022 equity incentive awards are subject to the Company&#8217;s stock ownership and retention requirements. Specifically, 50% of the net after-tax shares he receives from equity awards must be retained until one year after his retirement. These equity awards also are subject to the Company&#8217;s cancellation and clawback policies."

On November 1, 2023, Amazon.com, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;). The Credit Agreement replaces the prior $10.0 billion amended and restated credit agreement entered into by the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and other lenders on March 29, 2022, which was terminated on November 1, 2023. The Credit Agreement provides the Company with an unsecured revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $15.0 billion. The term of the Credit Agreement is five years, but it may be extended on one or more occasions for additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders.

&#160;

In addition, on November 1, 2023, the Company, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement (the &#8220;Short-Term Credit Agreement&#8221;). The Short-Term Credit Agreement replaces the prior $10.0 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement entered into by the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and other lenders on November 18, 2022, which was terminated on November 1, 2023. The Short-Term Credit Agreement provides the Company with an unsecured revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $5.0 billion. The term of the Short-Term Credit Agreement is 364 days, but it may be extended for an additional period of 364 days if approved by the lenders.

&#160;

The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility.

&#160;

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Credit Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes, including backstopping any notes that the Company may issue under its commercial paper program.

&#160;

The Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Credit Agreement contain customary representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default, but do not contain financial covenants. Upon an event of default that is not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the Credit Agreement or the Short-Term Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the commitments may be terminated.

&#160;

The financial institutions party to the Credit Agreement and the Short-Term Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage, and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of these financial institutions and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the Company and to persons and entities with relationships with the Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.

&#160;

The foregoing descriptions of the Credit Agreement and Short-Term Credit Agreement are qualified in their entirety by the terms of such agreements, which are filed hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

Effective May 7, 2024, The Home Depot, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) entered into three separate revolving credit facility agreements establishing three revolving credit facilities allowing for additional borrowings of up to $14.5 billion to support the Company&#8217;s expanded commercial paper programs in connection with the anticipated financing of the Company&#8217;s pending acquisition of SRS Distribution Inc. (the &#8220;SRS Acquisition&#8221;). The agreements consist of the following: 

&#8226; A 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of May 7, 2024 (the &#8220;364-Day Credit Agreement&#8221;), among the Company, the banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, establishing a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility (the &#8220;364-Day Credit Facility&#8221;). Commitments under the 364-Day Credit Facility will expire, and the 364-Day Credit Facility will mature, on May 6, 2025, unless terminated earlier; provided that the Company may elect to extend the maturity of outstanding loans (but not the commitments) for an additional one year period subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions and payment of a term out fee of 0.50% multiplied by the then outstanding loans under the 364-Day Credit Agreement. 

&#8226; A Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of May 7, 2024 (the &#8220;Three-Year Credit Agreement&#8221;), among the Company, the banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, establishing a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Three-Year Credit Facility&#8221;). Commitments under the Three-Year Credit Facility will expire, and the Three-Year Credit Facility will mature, on May 7, 2027, unless terminated earlier. 

&#8226; A Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as of May 7, 2024 (the &#8220;Capital Markets Credit Agreement&#8221;, and together with the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the Three-Year Credit Agreement, the &#8220;Credit Agreements&#8221;), among the Company, the banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, establishing a $10.0 billion revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Capital Markets Credit Facility&#8221;, and together with the 364-Day Credit Facility and the Three-Year Credit Facility, the &#8220;Credit Facilities&#8221;). Commitments under the Capital Markets Credit Facility will expire, and the Capital Markets Credit Facility will mature, on May 6, 2025, unless terminated earlier; provided that the Company may elect to extend the maturity of outstanding loans (but not the commitments) for an additional one year period subject to satisfaction certain customary conditions and payment of a term out fee of 0.50% multiplied by the then outstanding loans under the Capital Markets Credit Agreement. The Capital Markets Credit Agreement provides that the commitments under the Capital Markets Credit Facility will be reduced by the amount of net cash proceeds received by the Company from the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities issued in a public offering or pursuant to a Rule 144A private placement, if any, and, if the commitments as reduced exceed the outstanding loans or the commitments under the facility have been terminated, net cash proceeds from such an offering must be used to prepay outstanding borrowings under the Capital Markets Credit Facility. 

We currently intend to use borrowings, if any, under the Credit Facilities for general corporate purposes including to support our expanded commercial paper programs to fund the SRS Acquisition and/or, if necessary, to fund the SRS Acquisition. Fundings under the Credit Facilities are subject to conditions customary for financings of this type. 

Loans under the Credit Facilities will bear interest at a rate per year generally equal to, at our election, either: 

&#8226; At a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the interest rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate in the United States; (b) 0.50% plus the greater of (i) the federal funds effective rate and (ii) the overnight bank funding rate, each as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and (c) 1.0% in excess of the secured overnight financing rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) for a one-month interest period plus 0.10%, plus the applicable margin for such loans (&#8220;Base Rate Loans&#8221;); or 

&#8226; Term SOFR for the selected term which may be one, three or six months, plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% plus the applicable margin for such loans (&#8220;Term SOFR Loans&#8221;). 

The applicable margin for loans under the Credit Facilities will vary depending upon the Company&#8217;s ratings for senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money (the &#8220;Credit Ratings&#8221;). Based upon the Company&#8217;s current Credit Ratings, the applicable margin for Base Rate Loans would be 0.00% under all of the Credit Facilities, and the applicable margin for Term SOFR Loans would be 0.835% under the 364-Day Credit Facility and the Capital Markets Credit Facility and 0.810% under the Three-Year Credit Facility, provided that the applicable margin for Term SOFR Loans under the 364-Day Credit Facility will decrease to 0.710% and the applicable margin for Term SOFR Loans under the Three-Year Credit Facility will decrease to 0.685% once the Capital Markets Credit Facility is no longer outstanding. In addition, the Company will pay a facility fee on the commitments outstanding under each of the Credit Facilities, which also will vary depending on the 

Company&#8217;s Credit Ratings. Based on the Company&#8217;s current Credit Ratings, the facility fee would be 0.040% under the 364-Day Credit Facility and the Capital Markets Credit Facility and 0.065% under the Three-Year Credit Facility. The Company must also pay an additional duration fee equal to 0.10% of the commitments and loans outstanding under the Capital Markets Credit Facility on each of June 28, 2024 and December 13, 2024 if the Capital Markets Credit Facility is still in effect on those dates. 

The Credit Agreements contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type. The Credit Agreements also contain a mandatory commitment termination and prepayment upon the request of the Administrative Agent (acting at the request of lenders holding a majority of commitments or loans under the relevant Credit Facility) following the occurrence of a Change of Control as defined in the respective Credit Agreements. 

The foregoing descriptions of the Credit Agreements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreements, copies of which will be filed with the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 28, 2024."

On March 27, 2024, The Home Depot, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#8220; Company &#8221;), Star Acquisition Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220; Merger Sub &#8221;), Shingle Acquisition Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220; SRS &#8221;), and Shingle Acquisition, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, solely in its capacity as the initial Holder Representative, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8221;), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into SRS (the &#8220; Merger &#8221;), with SRS surviving the Merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will pay aggregate consideration of $18,250,000,000, subject to customary adjustments for SRS&#8217;s debt, cash, transaction expenses and net working capital (the &#8220; Merger Consideration &#8221;).

&#160;

At the effective time of the Merger (i) each share of SRS class A common stock and each share of SRS class B common stock (collectively, the &#8220; SRS Common Stock &#8221;, and each share, a &#8220; SRS Common Share &#8221;) that is issued and outstanding (other than any dissenting shares and SRS Common Shares, if any, held in treasury), will be converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the estimated Merger Consideration and (ii) each option to purchase SRS Common Shares (each option, a &#8220; SRS Option &#8221;) that is in-the-money will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the estimated Merger Consideration less the applicable exercise price with respect to such option. Out-of-the-money options will terminate and be forfeited for no consideration.

&#160;

In connection with the Merger, certain members of SRS&#8217;s management team have agreed to reinvest a portion of their respective after-tax proceeds from the Merger Consideration into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. A portion of such shares of Company common stock will be subject to service-based vesting conditions, and all such shares will be subject to transfer restrictions of various durations.

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of the parties customary for a transaction of this type. The Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants and agreements, including, among others: (i) certain limitations on the conduct of business of SRS between the date of the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing date of the Merger; (ii) regulatory matters, including the parties&#8217; efforts to consummate the closing and obtain approvals from governmental agencies; (iii) SRS&#8217;s obligation to deliver the required approval of SRS&#8217;s stockholders promptly following execution of the Merger Agreement; (iv) certain cooperation commitments by the Company with respect to the termination of SRS&#8217;s outstanding notes and SRS with respect to the Company&#8217;s transaction financing efforts; and (v) certain commitments by the Company with respect to the compensation and benefits provided to SRS employees post-closing.

&#160;

The parties&#8217; obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, among others: (i) the expiration of the waiting period applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (ii) the absence of any law or governmental order prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iii) no material adverse effect having occurred since the signing of the Merger Agreement; (iv) receipt of SRS&#8217;s stockholder approval; and (v) certain other customary conditions relating to the parties&#8217; representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and the performance of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Merger Agreement also provides for certain customary termination rights for the parties, including: (i) by mutual written consent of the Company and SRS; (ii) by either party, if the Closing has not occurred on or before the twelve-month anniversary of the date of the Merger Agreement (the &#8220; Initial Termination Date &#8221;), provided, that the Initial Termination Date will automatically be extended up to two times, for a period of six months in the first extension and three months in the second extension, in each case, if only the regulatory closing conditions relating to the antitrust laws remain unsatisfied (such date, as so extended beyond the Initial Termination Date, the &#8220; Termination Date &#8221;); (iii) by written notice to SRS from the Company if SRS&#8217;s stockholder approval is not obtained within two business days following execution of the Merger Agreement; (iv) by either party, if any governmental authority issues an order or permanently enjoins the transaction and such order or other action becomes final and non-appealable; and (v) if the other party has breached any of its representations and warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements such that any of the conditions to closing would not be satisfied and the party has not cured any such breaches within 30 days following delivery of written notice.

&#160;

The Company will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $894,250,000 (i) in the event SRS or the Company terminates the Merger Agreement due to an antitrust-related governmental prohibition on the transactions or (ii) if the closing has not occurred on or before the Termination Date, as described above, and, in either case, all closing conditions (other than (a) regulatory closing conditions relating to antitrust laws or (b) conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at the closing) are otherwise satisfied.

&#160;

The Merger Agreement will be filed to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any factual information about the Company, SRS or Merger Sub. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; are not intended as statements of fact to be relied upon by the Company&#8217;s stockholders or other security holders, but rather as a way of allocating the risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement in the event the statements therein prove to be inaccurate; have been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made between the parties in connection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement itself; may no longer be true as of a given date; and may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by the Company&#8217;s stockholders or other security holders. The Company&#8217;s stockholders or other security holders should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances of the Company, SRS or Merger Sub. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company&#8217;s public disclosures.

The Preferred Stock will accumulate dividends (which may be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of Common Stock or in any combination of cash and Common Stock) at a rate per annum equal to 6.00% on the liquidation preference thereof, which is $1,000 per share, payable when, as and if declared by the Company&#8217;s board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof), on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025 and ending on, and including, October 15, 2027. Unless earlier converted, each outstanding share of Preferred Stock will automatically convert for settlement on or about October 15, 2027, into between 5.8280 and 6.9940 shares of Common Stock (and, correspondingly, each Depositary Share will automatically convert into between 0.2914 and 0.3497 shares of Common Stock), subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, determined based on the average volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on, and including, the 21st scheduled trading day prior to October 15, 2027. Other than during a fundamental change conversion period (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), at any time prior to the mandatory conversion settlement date, a holder of 20 Depositary Shares may cause the Depositary to convert one share of Preferred Stock, on such holder&#8217;s behalf, into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the minimum conversion rate of 5.8280, subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments. 

In addition, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, each holder of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a liquidation preference in the amount of $1,000 per share of the Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to accumulated and unpaid dividends on the shares to, but excluding, the date fixed for liquidation, winding-up or dissolution to be paid out of the Company&#8217;s assets available for distribution to the Company&#8217;s shareholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to the Company&#8217;s creditors and holders of any senior stock and before any payment or distribution is made to holders of junior stock, including the Common Stock.

On October 14, 2024, The Boeing Company (&#8220;Boeing&#8221;) entered into a $10.0 billion supplemental credit agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) with BofA Securities, Inc. (&#8220;BofA&#8221;), Citibank, N.A. (&#8220;Citibank&#8221;), Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (&#8220;Goldman&#8221;) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (&#8220;JPMorgan&#8221;) as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, Citibank as administrative agent and BofA, Goldman and JPMorgan as co-syndication agents, and a syndicate of lenders as defined in the Credit Agreement. 

Under the Credit Agreement, Boeing will pay a funding fee of 0.50% of the aggregate principal amount of each advance made under the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, Boeing will also pay a duration fee between 0.50% and 1.00% of the aggregate amount of outstanding advances and unused commitments under the Credit Agreement, which shall be payable 90 to 270 days after the closing date, as applicable. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement that are not based on the secured overnight funding rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the highest of (1) the rate announced publicly by Citibank, from time to time, as its &#8220;base&#8221; rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (3) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a period of one month plus 1.00%, in each case plus between 0.375% and 1.00%, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement that are based on SOFR will generally bear interest based on Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus between 1.375% and 2.00%, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. Commitments under the Credit Agreement are scheduled to terminate 120 days after the date of the Credit Agreement and any outstanding advances mature 364 days after the date of the Credit Agreement. 

The Credit Agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting Boeing&#8217;s ability to permit consolidated debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in excess of 60% of Boeing&#8217;s total capital (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or to incur liens in excess of $250 million or merge or consolidate with another entity unless Boeing is the surviving entity. Events of default under the Credit Agreement include: (1) failure to pay outstanding principal or interest within five business days of when due, (2) determination that any representation or warranty was incorrect in any material respect when made, (3) failure to perform any other term, covenant or agreement, which failure is not remedied within 30 days of notice, (4) a cross-default with other debt in certain circumstances, (5) the incurrence of certain liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and (6) bankruptcy and other insolvency events. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders would have the right to accelerate and require the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the applicable agreement and would not be required to advance any additional funds. The Credit Agreement contains prepayment events that require Boeing to prepay outstanding advances or reduce the commitments if Boeing has any debt incurrence, equity issuance or disposition of assets, subject to customary terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. 

Certain of the lenders and their affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, for Boeing and its subsidiaries, various banking, underwriting, and other financial services, for which they receive customary fees and expenses. 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto."

On June 30, 2024, The Boeing Company (the &#8220; Company &#8221;) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8221;), by and among Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220; Spirit &#8221;), the Company, and Sphere Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Company (&#8220; Merger Sub &#8221;), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Spirit (the &#8220; Merger &#8221;), with Spirit surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the &#8220; Effective Time &#8221;), each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Spirit (&#8220; Spirit Common Stock &#8221;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Spirit Common Stock owned by the Company, Merger Sub, any other wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Spirit, or any wholly owned subsidiary of Spirit, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties) will be automatically cancelled and cease to exist and will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock, par value of $5 per share (&#8220; Company Common Stock &#8221; and such number of shares, the &#8220; Per Share Merger Consideration &#8221;), equal to (a) if the volume weighted average price per share of Company Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on and including the second full trading day prior to the Effective Time (the &#8220; Boeing Stock Price &#8221;), is greater than $149.00 but less than $206.94, the quotient obtained by dividing $37.25 by the Boeing Stock Price, rounded to four decimal places, or (b) if the Boeing Stock Price is greater than or equal to $206.94, 0.1800 or (c) if the Boeing Stock Price is equal to or less than $149.00, 0.2500 (the &#8220; Merger Consideration Shares &#8221;). The issuance of the Merger Consideration Shares will be registered under a registration statement on Form S-4 that will be filed by the Company, which will include a proxy statement of Spirit (the &#8220; Registration Statement &#8221;). 

The obligations of the Company and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Spirit, on the other hand, to effect the Merger are subject to various conditions, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Spirit Common Stock entitled to vote on the matter (the &#8220; Spirit Stockholder Approval &#8221;); the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of other specified regulatory approvals; effectiveness of the Registration Statement; approval of the listing of the Merger Consideration Shares on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to an official notice of issuance; the absence of any law or order that prohibits the consummation of the Merger; the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to certain materiality qualifiers); performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and, in the case of the Company and Merger Sub, the required regulatory approvals having been obtained without the imposition of a Burdensome Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement); the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) since the date of the Merger Agreement; and the completion of the sale of certain Spirit operations related to Airbus SE commercial work packages. 

Spirit has made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, and subject to certain exceptions, covenants to use reasonable best efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business during the period between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, not to engage in specified types of actions during this period, to convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Spirit Stockholder Approval and not to solicit or negotiate alternative proposals or modify in a manner adverse to the Company the recommendation of the Spirit Board of Directors that Spirit&#8217;s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. 

The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights, including that either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if, subject to certain limitations, the Merger has not closed by March 31, 2025 (subject to three automatic three-month extensions if on each such date all of the closing conditions except those relating to regulatory approvals have been satisfied or waived) (the &#8220; Outside Date &#8221;). Additionally, Spirit may terminate the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances to accept an unsolicited Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) from a third party, and the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement if, before the Spirit Stockholder Approval has been obtained, the Spirit Board of Directors changes its recommendation that Spirit&#8217;s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement. 

The Merger Agreement provides that Spirit will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $150 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances in which the Spirit Board of Directors changes its recommendation that Spirit&#8217;s stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement, Spirit terminates the Merger Agreement in order to accept a Superior Proposal as set forth in the Merger Agreement, or Spirit consummates a Qualifying Transaction (as defined in the Merger Agreement) following the termination of the Merger Agreement. 

The Merger Agreement also provides that the Company will be required to pay Spirit a termination fee of $300 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Spirit or the Company under certain specified circumstances in which the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of failing to obtain the required regulatory approvals by the Outside Date or as a result of a law or order related to the required regulatory approvals or any applicable antitrust law or foreign investment law that prohibits the consummation of the Merger. 

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, Spirit or any of their respective affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement as of the specific date therein, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 

This Report contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, each as amended.

Forward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to be accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these 

forward-looking statements. Among these factors are risks related to: the timely satisfaction of the conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction, including the Spirit Stockholder Approval; realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition (including anticipated synergies and quality improvements) in the expected timeframe or at all; the successful integration of Spirit into the Company&#8217;s business and operations; the occurrence of any event, change, or other circumstance that could give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the Merger Agreement; the ability of Spirit to enter into definitive agreements with Airbus SE, and consummate the related transactions, for the disposition of Spirit operations related to certain Airbus commercial work packages; reputational risk and potential adverse reactions of the Company&#8217;s or Spirit&#8217;s customers, regulators, employees or business partners, including those resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; the possibility that the proposed transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and time from ongoing business operations and opportunities on acquisition-related matters; legal, regulatory, tax and economic developments affecting the Company, Spirit and their respective businesses; the ability of the Company and Spirit to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed combination in a timely manner or at all; general conditions in the economy and the Company&#8217;s industry, including those due to regulatory changes; the Company&#8217;s reliance on the Company&#8217;s commercial airline customers; the overall health of the Company&#8217;s aircraft production system, production quality issues, commercial airplane production rates, the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully develop and certify new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and the ability of the Company&#8217;s aircraft to meet stringent performance and reliability standards; changing budget and appropriation levels and acquisition priorities of the U.S. government, as well as significant delays in U.S. government appropriations; the Company&#8217;s dependence on subcontractors and suppliers, as well as the availability of highly skilled labor and raw materials; work stoppages or other labor disruptions; competition within the Company&#8217;s markets; the Company&#8217;s non-U.S. operations and sales to non-U.S. customers; changes in accounting estimates; realizing the anticipated benefits of other mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures; the Company&#8217;s dependence on U.S. government contracts; the Company&#8217;s reliance on fixed-price contracts; the Company&#8217;s reliance on cost-type contracts; contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments; unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s, the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217; and/or the Company&#8217;s suppliers&#8217; information and systems; potential business disruptions, including threats to physical security or the Company&#8217;s information technology systems, extreme weather (including effects of climate change) or other acts of nature, and pandemics or other public health crises; potential adverse developments in new or pending litigation and/or government inquiries or investigations; potential environmental liabilities; effects of climate change and legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; credit rating agency actions and changes in the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain debt financing on commercially reasonable terms, at competitive rates and in sufficient amounts; substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; the adequacy of the Company&#8217;s insurance coverage; and customer and aircraft concentration in the Company&#8217;s customer financing portfolio.

On May 15, 2024, The Boeing Company (&#8220;Boeing&#8221;) entered into a $4.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Citibank, N.A.

(&#8220;JPMorgan&#8221;) as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, Citibank as administrative agent, JPMorgan as syndication agent, and a syndicate of lenders as defined in the Agreement. Under the Agreement, Boeing will pay a fee between 0.175% and 0.350% per annum on the commitments, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. Borrowings under the Agreement that are based on SOFR will generally bear interest equal to Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Agreement) plus between 1.200% and 1.650% per annum, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. All other borrowings under the Agreement will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the highest of (1) the rate announced publicly by Citibank, from time to time, as its &#8220;base&#8221; rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (3) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Agreement) for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 1.00%, plus in each of (1), (2) and (3) between 0.200% and 0.650% per annum, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. The Agreement is scheduled to terminate on May 15, 2029, subject to Boeing&#8217;s right to extend the term on any anniversary of the closing for one additional year.

Events of default under the Agreement include: (1) failure to pay outstanding principal or interest within five business days of when due, (2) determination that any representation or warranty was incorrect in any material respect when made, (3) failure to perform any other term, covenant or agreement, which failure is not remedied within 30 days of notice, (4) a cross-default with other debt in certain circumstances, (5) the incurrence of certain liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and (6) bankruptcy and other insolvency events. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders would have the right to accelerate and require the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the Agreement and would not be required to advance any additional funds. 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the Agreement, which is filed as exhibit 10.1 hereto. 

Certain of the lenders and their affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, for Boeing and its subsidiaries, various banking, underwriting, and other financial services, for which they receive customary fees and expenses.

On August 24, 2023, The Boeing Company (&#8220;Boeing&#8221;) entered into a $0.8 billion, 364-day revolving credit agreement (the &#8220;364-Day Credit Agreement&#8221;) with Citibank, N.A. (&#8220;Citibank&#8221;) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (&#8220;JPMorgan&#8221;) as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, Citibank as administrative agent, JPMorgan as syndication agent, and a syndicate of lenders as defined in such agreement. This facility replaces Boeing&#8217;s previous $5.8 billion, 364-day revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to terminate on August 24, 2023. Under the 364-Day Credit Agreement, Boeing will pay a fee of between 0.125% and 0.300% per annum on the commitments, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. Borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement that are based on SOFR will generally bear interest at an annual rate equal to Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the agreement) plus between 1.250% and 1.700% per annum, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. All other borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the highest of (1) the rate announced publicly by Citibank, from time to time, as its &#8220;base&#8221; rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (3) Adjusted Term SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 1.00%, plus in each of (1), (2) and (3) between 0.250% and 0.700% per annum, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is scheduled to terminate on August 22, 2024, subject to Boeing&#8217;s right to, following payment of additional fees, convert outstanding borrowings into term loans with a maturity date that is the one-year anniversary of the termination date, as well as Boeing&#8217;s right to request that the lenders extend the term for an additional 364 days. 

On August 24, 2023, Boeing also entered into a $3.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement (the &#8220;Five-Year Credit Agreement&#8221; and, together with the 364-Day Credit Agreement, the ""2023 Credit Agreements"") with Citibank and JPMorgan as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, Citibank as administrative agent, JPMorgan as syndication agent, and a syndicate of lenders as defined in such agreement. Under the Five-Year Credit Agreement, Boeing will pay a fee between 0.175% and 0.350% per annum on the commitments, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. Borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement that are based on SOFR will generally bear interest equal to Adjusted Term SOFR plus between 1.200% and 1.650% per annum, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. All other borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the highest of (1) the rate announced publicly by Citibank, from time to time, as its &#8220;base&#8221; rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (3) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the agreement) for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 1.00%, plus in each of (1), (2) and (3) between 0.200% and 0.650% per annum, depending on Boeing&#8217;s credit rating. The Five-Year Credit Agreement is scheduled to terminate on August 24, 2028, subject to Boeing&#8217;s right to extend the term on any anniversary of the closing for one additional year. 

The 2023 Credit Agreements contain customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting Boeing&#8217;s ability to permit consolidated debt (as defined in the applicable agreement) in excess of 60% of Boeing&#8217;s total capital (as defined in the applicable agreement), to incur liens, and to merge or consolidate with another entity. Events of default under the 2023 Credit Agreements include: (1) failure to pay outstanding principal or interest within five business days of when due, (2) determination that any representation or warranty was incorrect in any material respect when made, (3) failure to perform any other term, covenant or agreement, which failure is not remedied within 30 days of notice, (4) a cross-default with other debt in certain circumstances, (5) the incurrence of certain liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and (6) bankruptcy and other insolvency events. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders would have the right to accelerate and require the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the applicable agreement and would not be required to advance any additional funds. 

The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the Five-Year Credit Agreement, which are filed as exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto. 

Certain of the lenders and their affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, for Boeing and its subsidiaries, various banking, underwriting, and other financial services, for which they receive customary fees and expenses.

The Award reflects the Board&#8217;s recognition of and continued confidence in Mr. Calhoun&#8217;s strong leadership, and is designed to help retain Mr. Calhoun as he continues to lead the work to position the Company for the future as set forth in the Company&#8217;s Investor Conference on November 2, 2022. The number of shares included in the Award was set by the Board to match in size the number of shares purchased by Mr. Calhoun on the open market during the fourth quarter of 2022 and to further align Mr. Calhoun&#8217;s long-term interests with those of the Company&#8217;s other shareholders. Information on Mr. Calhoun&#8217;s 2022 compensation will be disclosed in the Company&#8217;s 2023 Proxy Statement, which the Company expects to file next month. 

The Award was made pursuant to the Company&#8217;s 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated, and is designed to vest in two equal installments on each of the first and second anniversaries of the grant date, subject to Mr. Calhoun&#8217;s continued employment by the Company. In the event Mr. Calhoun voluntarily leaves the Company for any reason (including retirement) prior to either vesting date, any unvested shares will be forfeited in their entirety. Under the terms of the Award, any vested shares would be distributed to Mr. Calhoun upon the later of the fourth anniversary of the grant date or his separation from the Company. The Award, including any additional vesting conditions, is subject to the U.S. Notice of Terms of Special Restricted Stock Units - CEO, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

In November 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity incident that impacted certain systems of Jeppesen, a wholly owned Boeing subsidiary that provides flight planning and navigation services. We determined that the incident posed no risk to flight safety. In addition, we promptly notified law enforcement and regulatory authorities and customers, launched an investigation, and took additional steps to protect the integrity of our systems. During the investigation, we learned that the criminal ransomware actor claims to have stolen information from Jeppesen systems. We continue to work with outside forensic firms, customers and relevant authorities to mitigate any potential impacts, including any possible release of personally identifiable information. We continue to be confident that this incident poses no risk to flight safety, and we believe that it has not had a material impact on either Jeppesen&#8217;s business operations or Boeing&#8217;s business prospects or financial results.

In connection with the restructuring program discussed above, on December 1, 2023, the Company concluded it will record an approximately $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) noncash impairment charge in the quarter ending December 31, 2023, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company&#8217;s 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.

The impairment charge arises from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusts the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value. Underlying performance of the Gillette business remains strong. However, future adverse changes in the business or macroeconomic environment may trigger a further impairment charge.

The Company is filing the information under this item pursuant to Item 2.06, &#8220;Material Impairments.&#8221;

The Procter &#38; Gamble Company (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) announced today a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to 1.5 billion after tax, including foreign currency translation losses to be recognized upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets. The Company estimates the large majority of these charges will be noncash.

Although the timing of the completion of this restructuring program has yet to be determined, the Company currently anticipates that these restructuring charges will be recognized in the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and 2025, with initial charges recognized in the quarter ending December 31, 2023.

Combining the restructuring program with an impairment charge described further below, the Company anticipates total charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion after tax over the periods described. The Company estimates a large majority of these charges will be noncash. These charges will be reported as non-core charges.

On April 11, 2023, the Board of Directors of The Procter &#38; Gamble Company (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) appointed Sheila Bonini, Senior Vice President &#8211; Private Sector Engagement for World Wildlife Fund, Inc., and Robert Portman, former United States Senator, as Directors of the Company, effective April 11, 2023.

Ms. Bonini will serve on the Governance &#38; Public Responsibility and Innovation &#38; Technology Committees. Mr. Portman will serve on the Audit and Governance &#38; Public Responsibility Committees.

The Board has determined that Ms. Bonini and Mr. Portman are each independent under the NYSE listing standards and the Company&#8217;s Independence Guidelines. Ms. Bonini and Mr. Portman will each receive the same compensation as the other non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The Company&#8217;s Director compensation program is described in the Company&#8217;s definitive proxy statement dated August 26, 2022.

In connection with the appointment of Ms. Bonini, the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the Company&#8217;s continued financial contributions to the World Wildlife Fund, Inc. (&#8220;WWF-US&#8221;) under the Company&#8217;s Related Person Transactions Policy. By virtue of her role at WWF-US, prior to her appointment as a Director, Ms. Bonini was involved in the discussion of the Company&#8217;s contributions to and partnership with WWF-US in support of various sustainability efforts and programs, although Ms. Bonini did not receive special benefits from the Company&#8217;s contributions. The Company has worked with and contributed to WWF-US since 2013. In its current fiscal year, the Company expects to contribute a total of approximately $550,000 to WWF-US under several partnership agreements. Upon her appointment as a Director of the Company, Ms. Bonini is no longer involved in and no longer has direct or indirect responsibility for WWF-US&#8217;s relationship with the Company, and she will not be involved in the negotiation of any future partnership terms or payments for as long as she remains a Director. In approving the Company&#8217;s continued contributions and partnership, the Board considered the Company&#8217;s long-standing support of WWF-US, the significant value to the Company of external partnerships with organizations focused on sustainability efforts, and the fact that, going forward, Ms. Bonini would not be involved in the Company&#8217;s financial relationship with WWF-US. Ultimately, the Board concluded that the partnership contributions were not inconsistent with the best interests of the Company as a whole.

On May 7, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the &#8220;Euro Notes Underwriting Agreement&#8221;) among the Company and the underwriters named therein (the &#8220;Euro Notes Underwriters&#8221;) in connection with the Company&#8217;s public offering (the &#8220;Euro Notes Offering&#8221;) of &#8364;500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Notes due 2032 and &#8364;500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.500% Notes due 2044 (collectively, the &#8220;Euro Notes&#8221; and, together with the Dollar Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). Pursuant to the Euro Notes Underwriting Agreement, the Company agreed to sell the Euro Notes to the Euro Notes Underwriters, and the Euro Notes Underwriters agreed to purchase the Euro Notes for resale to the public. The Euro Notes Offering is expected to close on or about May 14, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. 

&#160; 

The Euro Notes Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company. It also provides for customary indemnification by each of the Company and the Euro Notes Underwriters against certain liabilities and customary contribution provisions in respect of those liabilities. 

&#160; 

The offerings of the Notes were made pursuant to the Company&#8217;s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-268053) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on October 28, 2022. 

&#160; 

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offerings of the Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets and redemption and repayment of short-term or long-term borrowings, as well as for making any potential payments in connection with the Company&#8217;s ongoing tax litigation with the United States Internal Revenue Service.

&#160;

On May 1, 2024, the Company provided Ms. May with a letter confirming her new position and setting forth the primary compensation elements that will be effective commencing June 1, 2024.

5.02(e) 

&#160; 

As described in Item 5.07 below, at the Company&#8217;s 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareowners, the Company&#8217;s shareowners approved The Coca-Cola Company 2024 Equity Plan (the &#8220;2024 Plan&#8221;). On February 14, 2024, the Talent and Compensation Committee recommended that the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) adopt the 2024 Plan, and on February 15, 2024, the Board adopted the 2024 Plan, subject to shareowner approval at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. The effective date of the 2024 Plan is May 1, 2024. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The 2024 Plan will be administered by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised of independent Directors. The 2024 Plan authorizes the following types of awards to be made to employees, officers or Directors of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, as designated by the Talent and Compensation Committee: (1) stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights (&#8220;SARs&#8221;), (3) restricted stock and restricted stock units, (4) performance awards, and (5) other stock-based awards, in the discretion of the Talent and Compensation Committee, including unrestricted stock grants. 

&#160;

Subject to adjustment as provided in the 2024 Plan, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock reserved and available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2024 Plan is 240,000,000 plus any shares of Common Stock that are returned to the 2024 Plan share reserve under its provisions allowing shares to be reused for new grants. Each share issued pursuant to a stock option or SAR will reduce the number of shares available under the 2024 Plan by one share, and each share issued pursuant to awards other than stock options and SARs will reduce the number of shares available by three shares. 

&#160; 

Additional details of the 2024 Plan are included in the Company&#8217;s 2024 Proxy Statement, under the heading &#8220;Item 3 &#8211; Approval of The Coca-Cola Company 2024 Equity Plan.&#8221; The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the 2024 Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

On June 11, 2024, at NextEra Energy, Inc.'s (NEE) 2024 Investor Conference in New York, NY, members of NEE's senior management team plan to discuss, among other things, that NEE is reaffirming its adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2024, 2025 and 2026, and introducing its adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2027. NEE continues to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2024, 2025 and 2026 to be in the range of $3.23 to $3.43, $3.45 to $3.70 and $3.63 to $4.00, respectively, and now expects 2027 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.85 to $4.32. 

The adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the effects of non-qualifying hedges and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources, LLC's nuclear decommissioning funds and other than temporary impairments, none of which can be determined at this time. Adjusted earnings expectations also exclude the effects of NextEra Energy Partners, LP net investment gains and differential membership interests-related. In addition, adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; positive macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and Florida; supportive commodity markets; current forward curves; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; divestitures to NextEra Energy Partners, LP; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental policies or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results. Expected adjusted earnings amounts cannot be reconciled to expected net income because net income includes the effect of certain items which cannot be determined at this time. NEE's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NEE also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors.

Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations of NextEra Energy, Inc.

You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance. The future results of NextEra Energy and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, or may require it to limit or eliminate certain operations.

terrorism, cyberattacks or other attempts to disrupt NextEra Energy's business or the businesses of third parties; inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage for protection of NextEra Energy against significant losses and risk that insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; a prolonged period of low gas and oil prices could impact NextEra Energy&#8217;s gas infrastructure business and cause NextEra Energy to delay or cancel certain gas infrastructure projects and could result in certain projects becoming impaired; risk of increased operating costs resulting from unfavorable supply costs necessary to provide full energy and capacity requirement services; inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risk within its portfolio; effect of reductions in the liquidity of energy markets on NextEra Energy's ability to manage operational risks; effectiveness of NextEra Energy's risk management tools associated with its hedging and trading procedures to protect against significant losses, including the effect of unforeseen price variances from historical behavior; impact of unavailability or disruption of power transmission or commodity transportation facilities on sale and delivery of power or natural gas; exposure of NextEra Energy to credit and performance risk from customers, hedging counterparties and vendors; failure of counterparties to perform under derivative contracts or of requirement for NextEra Energy to post margin cash collateral under derivative contracts; failure or breach of NextEra Energy's information technology systems; risks to NextEra Energy's retail businesses from compromise of sensitive customer data; losses from volatility in the market values of derivative instruments and limited liquidity in over-the-counter markets; impact of negative publicity; inability to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate acceptable franchise agreements; occurrence of work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs; NextEra Energy's ability to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, including the effect of increased competition for acquisitions; environmental, health and financial risks associated with ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities; liability of NextEra Energy for significant retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums in the event of an incident at certain nuclear generation facilities; increased operating and capital expenditures and/or reduced revenues at nuclear generation facilities resulting from orders or new regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; inability to operate any of NextEra Energy&#8217;s owned nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions; effect of disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets or actions by third parties in connection with project-specific or other financing arrangements on NextEra Energy's ability to fund its liquidity and capital needs and meet its growth objectives; inability to maintain current credit ratings; impairment of liquidity from inability of credit providers to fund their credit commitments or to maintain their current credit ratings; poor market performance and other economic factors that could affect NextEra Energy's defined benefit pension plan's funded status; poor market performance and other risks to the asset values of nuclear decommissioning funds; changes in market value and other risks to certain of NextEra Energy's investments; effect of inability of NextEra Energy subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to NextEra Energy or of NextEra Energy's performance under guarantees of subsidiary obligations on NextEra Energy's ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock; the fact that the amount and timing of dividends payable on NextEra Energy's common stock, as well as the dividend policy approved by NextEra Energy's board of directors from time to time, and changes to that policy, are within the sole discretion of NextEra Energy's board of directors and, if declared and paid, dividends may be in amounts that are less than might be expected by shareholders; NextEra Energy Partners, LP&#8217;s inability to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms could have an effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and on the value of NextEra Energy&#8217;s limited partner interest in NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP; effects of disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets on the market price of NextEra Energy's common stock; and the ultimate severity and duration of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, and its effects on NextEra Energy&#8217;s business.

On March 1, 2024, NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH) issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of its 3.00% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2027 (the notes) pursuant to an indenture dated as of March 1, 2024 (the indenture) among NEECH, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE), NEECH&#8217;s corporate parent, as guara ntor, and The Bank of New York Mellon , as trustee. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 3.00% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. The notes will mature on March 1, 2027, unless earlier purchased by NEECH or exchanged in accordance with their terms. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately $990 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts. Pursuant to a purchase agreement entered into on February 27, 2024, the notes were sold to the initial purchasers thereof in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), for resale to qualified institutional buyers as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act. 

The notes are unsecured obligations of NEECH and are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by NEE. A holder may exchange all or a portion of its notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date in accordance with the indenture. Upon exchange, NEECH will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be exchanged and has the right, at its sole discretion, to pay or deliver or cause NEE to deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of NEE common stock or a combination of both, in respect of the remainder, if any, of NEECH's exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being exchanged. The initial exchange rate is 14.6927 shares of NEE common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $68.06 per share of NEE common stock on February 27, 2024. This represents a premium of approximately 22.5% above the $55.56 closing price of NEE common stock on February 27, 2024. The value to be delivered upon the exchange of the notes (in excess of the principal thereof) is expected to be offset by the value of the capped call transactions (see Item 8.01) up to an initial share price of $83.34. The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, as set forth in the indenture. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture), NEECH will, in certain circumstances, increase the exchange rate by a number of additional shares of NEE common stock for a holder that elects to exchange its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. To the extent that any shares of NEE common stock become issuable upon exchange of the notes, they will be issued in transactions anticipated to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act. 

Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture) holders of the notes may require NEECH to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash in an amount equal to the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The notes are not redeemable at NEECH&#8217;s option prior to their maturity. 

The indenture contains, among other provisions, certain default and acceleration provisions relating to the failure to make required payments and deliveries on the notes or to observe other covenants in the indenture and related documents and certain bankruptcy-related events. 

The foregoing description of the indenture and the notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the indenture (including the form of notes), a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

NEECH used $52 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to pay the costs of capped call transactions entered into by NEE with certain financial institutions. The capped call transactions have an aggregate notional amount of approximately $1.0 billion and an initial strike price of $68.06 and a cap price of $83.34 in each case per share of NEE common stock and subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.The capped call transactions may be settled with cash or, at NEE's election, with shares of NEE common stock. Any capped call settlement value is expected to offset the value to be delivered upon exchange of the notes (as applicable) as a result of share price improvement up to the cap price, which will be subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions.

NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE or we) and Florida Power &#38; Light Company (FPL) are furnishing the following statement to be made by the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NEE during NEE&#8217;s webcast report on its fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 financial results on the date of this report: 

As a reminder, we reported last quarter that we were reviewing allegations of Florida state and federal campaign finance law violations raised in media articles and a related complaint filed in October 2022 with the Federal Election Commission. Our review of information reasonably available to us is now substantially complete. Regarding the Florida allegations, based on information in our possession, we believe that FPL would not be found liable for any of the Florida campaign finance law violations as alleged in the media articles. With respect to the FEC complaint, you may recall that it was filed by a special interest group and primarily relies on media articles to allege certain violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act by various parties, including, by implication, FPL. The FEC process is a confidential, civil administrative process, with an investigation only commencing if the FEC votes to do so, which decision likely will not occur until late this year. We plan to file our response seeking dismissal of the complaint in the next few weeks and do not believe it is appropriate for a complaint such as this to move forward. The total amount of contributions referenced in the complaint is less than $1.3 million and we do not expect that allegations of federal campaign finance law violations taken as a whole would be material to us.

(b) The following risk factor is filed herewith: 

Allegations of violations of law by FPL or NEE have the potential to result in fines, penalties, or other sanctions or effects, as well as cause reputational damage for FPL and NEE, and could hamper FPL&#8217;s and NEE&#8217;s effectiveness in interacting with governmental authorities 

FPL&#8217;s and NEE&#8217;s business and reputation could be adversely affected by allegations that FPL or NEE has violated laws, by any investigations or proceedings that arise from such allegations, or by ultimate determinations of legal violations. For example, media articles have been published that allege, among other things, Florida state and federal campaign finance law violations by FPL. These articles are referenced in a complaint subsequently filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) that alleges certain violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act. FPL and NEE cannot guarantee that the FEC complaint process will not ultimately result in a finding that FPL or NEE violated federal campaign finance or other laws, that applicable federal or state governmental authorities may not investigate or take enforcement actions with respect to the allegations or assert that legal violations by FPL or NEE have occurred, or that violations may not ultimately be found by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authorities to have occurred. 

In addition, notwithstanding the completion or pendency of any internal review or investigation by FPL or NEE of any allegations of legal violations, including of the allegations regarding campaign finance laws set forth in the media articles or FEC complaint, FPL and NEE cannot provide assurance that any of the foregoing will not result in the imposition of material fines, penalties, or otherwise result in other sanctions or effects on FPL or NEE, or will not have a material adverse impact on the reputation of NEE or FPL or on the effectiveness of their interactions with governmental regulators or other authorities."

The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of NEE exercised its discretion to make the determination that it is in the best interests of the Company to enter into the Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement, subject to Mr. Silagy&#8217;s execution of a release of claims in favor of NEE, Mr. Silagy will receive an annual incentive award payout for 2022 calculated in accordance with NEE&#8217;s annual incentive plan and, consistent with the terms of Mr. Silagy&#8217;s equity awards upon a normal retirement at least at age 55 with at least 10 years of service (which Mr. Silagy has met), a pro rata portion of Mr. Silagy&#8217;s outstanding performance share, restricted share and stock option awards will continue to remain outstanding and vest after his retirement in accordance with their terms, subject to the achievement of NEE&#8217;s performance objectives, if applicable. Mr. Silagy is subject to two-year post-employment restrictive covenants, including non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, and to a customary non-disparagement covenant. The payments and benefits under the Agreement are subject to forfeiture and recoupment in certain circumstances, including if Mr. Silagy violates the post-employment restrictive covenants or upon the occurrence of specified events, as defined in the Agreement. 

The foregoing description of the Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as exhibit 10 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated in this Item 5.02(e) by reference.

The 2023 Annual Incentive Plan is intended to replace, on substantially similar terms, NextEra Energy's existing 2013 Executive Annual Incentive Plan, which expires on December 31, 2022. 

Eligibility to participate in the 2023 Annual Incentive Plan is restricted to key employees of the NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries and affiliates who are designated under the 2023 Annual Incentive Plan as &#8220;executives.&#8221; The Compensation Committee has the authority to select the executives eligible to participate in the 2023 Annual Incentive Plan and may delegate to one or more of its members or to one or more executive officers, acting jointly or singly, its authority to select certain additional executives as participants. 

Under the 2023 Annual Incentive Plan, NextEra Energy may pay annual incentive compensation to executives designated to participate. The maximum annual incentive NextEra Energy may pay under the 2023 Annual Incentive Plan to any participant for any year is $15,000,000. The amount of such annual incentive compensation will vary based on the level of attainment relative to one or more performance goals pre-established by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee retains discretion to reduce, but not increase, the annual incentive compensation payable to any participant. In addition, the annual incentive compensation may be $0 if the performance goal is not achieved. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, awards under the 2023 Annual Incentive Plan will be payable in cash. 

The 2023 Annual Incentive Plan authorizes the establishment of corporate performance goals based on any one or more performance measures, including those specified in the plan. 

The corporate performance goals under the 2023 Annual Incentive Plan may be expressed on an absolute and/or relative basis, a before-tax or after-tax basis, or a consolidated or business-unit basis, may be based on or otherwise employ comparisons based on internal targets, the past performance of NextEra Energy and/or the past or current performance of other companies, and may include or exclude any or all extraordinary, non-core, non-operating or non-recurring items, or such other items as the Compensation Committee may determine.

DEF intends to propose a three-year rate plan that would begin in January 2025, once its current base rate settlement agreement concludes at the end of this year. DEF will propose multi-year rate increases that use the projected 12-month periods ending December 31, 2025, 2026, and 2027 as the test years, with adjusted rates to be effective with the first billing period of January 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively. DEF expects to request additional base rate revenue requirements of approximately $596 million in 2025, $95 million in 2026 and $127 million in 2027. This is an average annual increase in revenue requirements of approximately 4% percent over 2025 through 2027.

On December 14, 2023, the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) of Duke Energy Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) adopted Amended and Restated By-Laws (the &#8220;By-Laws&#8221;), effective immediately. The amendments adopt a forum selection by-law to provide that unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum: (A)(i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or agent or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation&#8217;s stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or the By-Laws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware, may be brought only before the Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear such action, another state court located within the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware, and (B) the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;).

&#160;

The Corporation chose to adopt the forum selection by-law to avoid the potential costs and uncertainty of parallel litigation in multiple venues, the risk of inconsistent rulings, and the possible misapplication of law by a foreign court(s). In addition, as a Delaware corporation, the Corporation chose the Delaware Court of Chancery as the primary venue for non-Securities Act claims as it is widely regarded as the country&#8217;s preeminent business court, due to its extensive body of judicial precedent and the expertise of its jurists who have a deep understanding of Delaware corporate law and long-standing precedent regarding corporations&#8217; governance.

&#160;

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-Laws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

On June 9, 2023 (the &#8220;Execution Date&#8221;), Duke Energy Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Duke Energy&#8221;), through certain of its affiliates, entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with affiliates of Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. providing for the sale of materially all of the Company&#8217;s utility-scale solar and wind group, which comprises part of the Company&#8217;s Commercial Renewables business segment and which was classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2022 (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). Completion of the Transaction is expected to occur before the end of 2023 and is subject to certain customary regulatory and other approvals and conditions.

&#160; 

As of the Execution Date, Duke Energy expects to recognize an estimated pre-tax impairment charge on the Assets Held for Sale of approximately $800 million in the second quarter of 2023 based upon the purchase price in the Transaction. The impairment charge will be classified in discontinued operations in Duke Energy&#8217;s Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase price is subject to certain customary adjustments at closing, including based upon variances in working capital compared to target amounts, and post-closing adjustments for variances in capital expenditures and third party tax equity financing for development projects compared to target amounts. The income tax implications of the Transaction on 2023 earnings continue to be assessed.

On June 12, 2023, Duke Energy announced that it is reaffirming its 2023 adjusted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) guidance range of $5.55 to $5.75, and its long-term adjusted EPS growth rate of 5-7% through 2027 off the 2023 midpoint of $5.65. Forecasted adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure as it represents basic EPS available to Duke Energy common stockholders, adjusted for the per share impact of special items. Special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy&#8217;s ongoing performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted EPS is reported basic EPS available to Duke Energy common stockholders. Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP financial measure for future periods, information to reconcile it to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to project all special items for future periods, such as legal settlements, the impact of regulatory orders or asset impairments, which may be significant.

&#160;

This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on management&#8217;s beliefs and assumptions and can often be identified by terms and phrases that include &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;predict,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;guidance,&#8221; &#8220;outlook&#8221; or other similar terminology.

&#9702; The results of financing efforts, including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, which can be affected by various factors, including credit ratings, interest rate fluctuations, compliance with debt covenants and conditions, an individual utility&#8217;s generation mix, and general market and economic conditions; &#160;

&#9702; Credit ratings of the Duke Energy Registrants may be different from what is expected; &#160;

&#9702; Declines in the market prices of equity and fixed-income securities and resultant cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust funds; &#160;

&#9702; Construction and development risks associated with the completion of the Duke Energy Registrants&#8217; capital investment projects, including risks related to financing, timing and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, obtaining and complying with terms of permits, meeting construction budgets and schedules and satisfying operating and environmental performance standards, as well as the ability to recover costs from customers in a timely manner, or at all; &#160;

&#9702; The impact of United States tax legislation to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and our credit ratings; &#160;

&#9702; The impacts from potential impairments of goodwill or equity method investment carrying values; &#160;

&#9702; Asset or business acquisitions and dispositions may not yield the anticipated benefits; and &#160;

&#9702; The actions of activist shareholders could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to execute on our business strategy, or cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock. &#160;

None of the shares remaining for issuance under the 2015 Plan will be carried over to the 2023 Plan. The 2023 Plan will remain in effect until May 4, 2033, unless sooner terminated by the board of directors. Termination will not affect awards then outstanding.

&#160;

On April 6, 2023, Duke Energy Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) completed the sale of $1,725,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), which included an additional $225,000,00 aggregate principal amount of Notes purchased pursuant to the full exercise of the option granted to the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (as defined herein), in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;). The Notes were sold under a purchase agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) dated April 3, 2023 among the Corporation and the initial purchasers (the &#8220;Initial Purchasers&#8221;) party thereto. The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.125% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2023. The Notes will be convertible into cash or a combination of cash and shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (&#8220;Common Stock&#8221;), as described below. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation, and will mature on April 15, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms.

&#160;

The Corporation issued the Notes pursuant to an indenture (the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;), dated as of April 6, 2023 by and between the Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;).

&#160;

Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15, 2026, the Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions. On or after January 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at their option at any time at the conversion rate then in effect, irrespective of these conditions.

&#160;

The Corporation will settle conversions of the Notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of its Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of its Common Stock, at its election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted . The conversion rate for the Notes will initially be 8.4131 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $118.86 per share of Common Stock). The initial conversion price of the Notes represents a premium of approximately 25% over the last reported sale price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on April 3, 2023. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. The Corporation may not redeem the Notes prior to the maturity date.

&#160;

If the Corporation undergoes a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes may require the Corporation to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (as defined in the Indenture). In addition, if a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Corporation may be required, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for any Notes converted in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change by a specified number of shares of its Common Stock.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Indenture provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to grace and cure periods), among others: nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of covenants or other agreements in the Indenture; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. Generally, if an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 33% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to be immediately due and payable.

&#160;

The Notes will be the Corporation&#8217;s direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations, ranking equally in priority with all of the Corporation&#8217;s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of the Corporation&#8217;s existing and future subordinated debt.

&#160;

The disclosure in this Item 2.03 is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the Indenture, together with the form of global note evidencing the Notes included therein, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto. Such exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

The information included or incorporated by reference in Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Notes were sold to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for resale to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A of the Securities Act.

&#160;

The Notes and the underlying shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Initially, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, including pursuant to any increase in the conversion rate for any Notes converted in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, is 18,140,618, subject to anti-dilution adjustments.

Forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that are beyond Dow&#8217;s control, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements and speak only as of the date the statements were made.

Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished.

On February 15, 2024, the Board approved amendments to the Company&#8217;s Bylaws and readopted them in full (as amended and restated, the &#8220;Bylaws&#8221;), effective immediately, to update certain procedural requirements related to director nominations and solicitations of proxies by stockholders, including requiring compliance with Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and to incorporate other changes as well as ministerial, clarifying and conforming edits.

Specifically, the Bylaws provide, among other things, that the stockholder must include in its advance notice of nomination: (i) a representation that the stockholder intends to solicit proxies from the holders of the Company&#8217;s outstanding capital stock representing at least sixty-seven percent of the voting power of capital stock entitled to vote on the election of directors and has otherwise complied or will comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 of the Exchange Act, and (ii) a representation that such stockholder will update in writing any required notice, if necessary, so that the information provided is true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting and as of the date that is ten business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Furthermore, the Bylaws require that a stockholder soliciting proxies from other stockholders use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for exclusive use by the Board.

Additional changes to the Bylaws include updating the committee responsibilities to align with the committee charters and current Board practice as well as removing the requirement for the Company to produce and keep for examination by any stockholder at the time and place of a meeting of stockholders a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, which conform to amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law.

On April 13, 2023, Dow Inc. (&#8220;Dow&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) held its 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (&#8220;2023 Meeting&#8221;). As of the close of business on February 15, 2023, the record date for the 2023 Meeting, 707,988,709 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. A total of 583,077,512 shares of common stock were voted in person or by proxy, representing 82.4% of the shares entitled to be voted and constituting a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes were included in determining the presence of a quorum at the 2023 Meeting.

The Company&#8217;s Bylaws prescribe the voting standard for election of Directors as a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, such as this one, where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of Directors to be elected. Agenda Items must receive more for votes than against votes in order to be approved. Abstentions and broker non-votes were not counted and did not have an effect on the outcome of any matter except with respect to Agenda Item 3 (collectively, the &#8220;Voting Standard&#8221;).

Summary of Final Voting Results of the 2023 Annual Meeting. 

The following is a summary of the final voting results on the matters considered and voted upon at the 2023 Meeting, all of which are described in the Company&#8217;s Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 3, 2023 (the &#8220;Proxy Statement&#8221;).

In accordance with the Voting Standard, stockholders voted in favor of Agenda Item 1 (Election of Directors), with each of the twelve Director nominees named in the Proxy Statement receiving votes in favor of their election in the range of 93-98%. Stockholders voted in favor of each of the management proposals, as Agenda Item 2 (Advisory Resolution to Approve Executive Compensation) received 91% of the votes cast in favor of the resolution and Agenda Item 3 (Ratification of the Appointment of Deloitte &#38; Touche LLP as the Company&#8217;s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2023) received 95% of the votes cast in favor of the resolution. Stockholders voted against each of the stockholder proposals, as Agenda Item 4 (Stockholder Proposal&#8212;Independent Board Chairman) received 74% of the votes cast against the resolution and Agenda Item 5 (Stockholder Proposal&#8212;Single-Use Plastics Report) received 70% of the votes cast against the resolution. All percentages set forth above are rounded to the nearest whole number. Details of the final voting results are set forth below.

The following are the detailed final voting results on each of the matters considered and voted upon at the 2023 Meeting, all of which are described in the Proxy Statement.

Dow outlines targeted actions to deliver $1B in cost savings in 2023 

&#8226; Proactive actions will optimize Dow&#8217;s cost structure in response to near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, while maintaining long-term value creation focus 

&#8226; Company continues its Decarbonize and Grow strategy as well as its disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation 

MIDLAND, Mich. &#8211; January 26, 2023 &#8211; Dow Inc. (NYSE: DOW) today outlined a series of targeted actions aligned to its previously stated plan to achieve $1 billion in cost savings in 2023. The proactive actions will further optimize the Company&#8217;s cost structure in response to near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, while maintaining its long-term competitiveness across the economic cycle. 

Specifically, Dow expects to realize $1 billion in cost savings in 2023 through: 

&#8226; Structural improvements of $500 million, maintaining a low cost-to-serve operating model: 

&#9702; Optimizing labor and services costs, including a global workforce reduction of approximately 2,000 roles; 

&#9702; Shutting down select assets, while further evaluating Dow&#8217;s global asset base, particularly in Europe, to ensure long-term competitiveness and enhance cost efficiency; and 

&#9702; Increasing productivity via end-to-end process improvements. 

&#8226; Operating expense reductions of $500 million, focused on near-term cash flow: 

&#9702; Decreasing turnaround spending, with a continued focus on maintaining safety and reliability; 

&#9702; Reducing purchased raw materials, logistics and utilities costs; and 

&#9702; Aligning spending levels to the macroeconomic environment. 

&#8220;We are taking these actions to further optimize our cost structure and prioritize business operations toward our most competitive, cost-advantaged and growth-oriented markets, while also navigating macro uncertainties and challenging energy markets, particularly in Europe,&#8221; said Jim Fitterling, Dow chairman and CEO. &#8220;We remain committed to capitalizing on our long-term growth opportunities in a disciplined and balanced manner, and these actions further position us to advance our Decarbonize and Grow strategy and strengthen our competitive position.&#8221; 

The Company will record a charge of $550 million to $725 million in the first quarter of 2023 for costs associated with these activities, which primarily include severance and related benefit costs; costs associated with exit and disposal activities; and asset write-downs and write-offs. 

Longer-term, Dow remains on track to grow its underlying EBITDA by greater than $3 billion by 2030 while reducing its carbon emissions by 30 percent versus its 2005 baseline as it progresses on its path to carbon neutrality by 2050. 

As Dow implements the actions announced today, the Company will engage local stakeholders in each region and in compliance with local regulations and consultation processes.

(e) On December 15, 2023, the Compensation and Executive Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Nucor Corporation adopted and approved an amendment and restatement of the Nucor Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan for Executive Officers (the &#8220;SERP&#8221;), effective immediately. The amendment and restatement of the SERP changed the age eligibility requirement for a normal retirement benefit and incorporated into one document the terms of a prior amendment to the SERP. 

An Executive Officer will become eligible to receive a normal retirement benefit under the amended and restated SERP upon his or her retirement after the earlier of (a) attaining age 60 or (b) attaining age 55 and completing seven years of service as an Executive Officer. An Executive Officer became eligible to receive a normal retirement benefit under the SERP prior to its amendment and restatement upon his or her retirement after the earlier of (a) attaining age 60 or (b) attaining age 58 and completing seven years of service as an Executive Officer. The normal retirement benefit, which was not changed by the amendment and restatement of the SERP, is a monthly benefit equal to 3.36 times the Executive Officer&#8217;s monthly base salary payable for 24 months. 

If an Executive Officer has not satisfied the eligibility requirement(s) for a normal retirement benefit at the time of his or her termination of employment and has attained age 55, the monthly benefit payable under the SERP will be equal to the Executive Officer&#8217;s normal retirement benefit reduced by 1/84th for each month the Executive Officer&#8217;s termination precedes the date the Executive Officer would have completed seven years of service as an Executive Officer. If the Executive Officer, however, has not attained age 55, the monthly benefit payable under the SERP will be equal to fifty percent (50%) of the benefit the Executive Officer would have received on early retirement had the Executive Officer attained age 55 at the time of his or termination of employment. 

The foregoing description of the amendment and restatement of the SERP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such amendment and restatement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

On October 22, 2024, Verizon Communications Inc. (&#8220;Verizon&#8221;) hosted a sell side analyst meeting where it shared a strategic broadband update and held a question and answer session with analysts. 

Copies of the press release and the investor presentation related to this event, as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, are attached as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3, and incorporated herein by reference. 

The information provided pursuant to this Item 7.01 is &#8220;furnished&#8221; and shall not be deemed to be &#8220;filed&#8221; with the Securities and Exchange Commission or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in any such filings. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

Verizon&#8217;s press release and investor presentation attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon&#8217;s GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. 

Consolidated EBITDA 

Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as it is a widely accepted financial measure used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. 

Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe provides relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is used by investors to compare a company&#8217;s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit non-strategic portions of certain businesses, as part of our continued transformation initiatives. Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023. 

Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio 

Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon&#8217;s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. 

Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio target because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the timeline for achieving the target or the special items that could arise in future periods. 

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities."

Attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated October 22, 2024, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated October 22, 2024, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2024. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

Verizon&#8217;s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. 

EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures 

Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. 

Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. 

Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company&#8217;s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, legacy legal matter, Verizon Business Group (""Verizon Business"") goodwill impairment, legal settlement, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2024 relate to separations under our voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Asset and business rationalization recorded during 2024 predominately relates to the decision to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit non-strategic portions of certain businesses, as part of our continued transformation initiatives. A sset rationalization recorded during the second quarter of 2023 relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Asset rationalization recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily relates to Verizon Business network assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment test. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio 

Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon&#8217;s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. 

Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. 

Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast 

Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. 

Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, severance charges, asset and business rationalization, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. 

We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition&#8217;s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) 

Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the effect of special items. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. 

Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Special Items 

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is used by investors to more accurately compare a company&#8217;s operating expenses to those of its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. In addition, the exclusion of the effects of special items allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. 

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special items: severance charges, asset and business rationalization, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. 

See the accompanying schedules for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP."

Verizon Communications Inc. (the Company and, together with its subsidiaries, Verizon) expects the following items to impact its reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024: 

&#8226; In June 2024, Verizon announced a voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees. Approximately 4,800 eligible employees will separate from Verizon under this program by the end of March 2025, with over half of these employees exiting in September of 2024. Principally as a result of this program but also as a result of other headcount reduction initiatives, the Company expects to record a severance charge in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion ($1.3 billion to $1.4 billion after-tax) in the third quarter of 2024. 

&#8226; As part of its continued transformation initiatives, in September 2024, Verizon plans to cease use of certain real estate assets and exit non-strategic portions of certain businesses. As a result of these strategic actions, the Company expects to record asset and business rationalization charges in the range of $230 million to $380 million ($170 million to $290 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2024.

The Merger will become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later effective time and date that is agreed to by Verizon and Frontier and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the &#8220;Effective Time&#8221;).

At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Frontier (the &#8220;Frontier Common Stock&#8221;) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but excluding (i) any shares of Frontier Common Stock that are owned by Verizon or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or owned by Frontier immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any shares of Frontier Common Stock as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $38.50 per share, without interest (the &#8220;Merger Consideration&#8221;).

Verizon and Frontier have agreed to various customary covenants, including covenants regarding the conduct of Frontier&#8217;s business prior to the Closing, covenants requiring Frontier to recommend that its stockholders approve the Merger Agreement and covenants prohibiting Frontier from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals or providing information to or engaging in discussions with third parties, in each case, except in limited circumstances as provided in the Merger Agreement.

Consummation of the Transactions is subject to certain customary conditions, including (i) approval of the Transactions by the requisite vote of Frontier&#8217;s stockholders (the &#8220;Company Stockholder Approval&#8221;), (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of required approvals from the Federal Communications Commission and certain local franchise authorities and state public utility commissions, subject to certain conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, (iii) the absence of any legal restraint prohibiting the Transactions, (iv) the accuracy of each party&#8217;s representations and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers) and (v) each party&#8217;s compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement in all material respects.

The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party under certain circumstances, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Frontier may be required to pay Verizon a termination fee of $320 million and, under other specified circumstances, Verizon may be required to pay Frontier a termination fee of $590 million.

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the other Transactions is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference."

Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. 

EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures 

Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. 

Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. 

Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company&#8217;s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: legacy legal matter, severance charges, Verizon Business Group (""Verizon Business"") goodwill impairment, asset rationalization, legal settlement, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment test. Asset rationalization recorded during the second quarter of 2023 relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Asset rationalization recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily relates to Verizon Business network assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our continued transformation initiatives. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio 

Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon&#8217;s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. 

Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. 

Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast 

Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. 

Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, severance, pension and benefits charges and asset rationalization. 

We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition&#8217;s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) 

Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the effect of special items. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. 

Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Special Items 

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is used by investors to more accurately compare a company&#8217;s operating expenses to those of its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. In addition, the exclusion of the effects of special items allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. 

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special items: severance charges and asset rationalization.

Attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated April 22, 2024, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated April 22, 2024, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2024. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

Verizon&#8217;s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. 

EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures 

Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. 

Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. 

Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company&#8217;s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: legacy legal matter, severance charges, Verizon Business Group (""Verizon Business"") goodwill impairment, asset rationalization, legal settlement, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. Legacy legal matter recorded during 2024 relates to a litigation matter associated with a legacy contract for the production of telephone directories in Costa Rica by a subsidiary of Verizon. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment test. Asset rationalization recorded during the second quarter of 2023 relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Asset rationalization recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily relates to Verizon Business network assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our continued transformation initiatives. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio 

Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon&#8217;s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. 

Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. 

Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast 

Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. 

Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and legacy legal matter. 

We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition&#8217;s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) 

Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the effect of special items. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. 

Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Special Items 

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is used by investors to more accurately compare a company&#8217;s operating expenses to those of its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. In addition, the exclusion of the effects of special items allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. 

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special item: legacy legal matter.

On February 29, 2024, Verizon Communications Inc. (&#8220;Verizon&#8221;) entered into two separate commitment agreements, one by and between Verizon, State Street Global Advisors Trust Company (&#8220;State Street&#8221;), as independent fiduciary of the Verizon Management Pension Plan and Verizon Pension Plan for Associates (the &#8220;Pension Plans&#8221;), and The Prudential Insurance Company of America (&#8220;Prudential&#8221;), and one by and between Verizon, State Street and RGA Reinsurance Company (&#8220;RGA&#8221;), under which the Pension Plans purchased a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract from Prudential and a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract from RGA to settle approximately $5.9 billion of benefit liabilities of the Pension Plans. 

The purchase of the group annuity contracts closed on March 6, 2024. The group annuity contracts primarily cover a population that includes 56,000 retirees who commenced benefit payments from the Pension Plans prior to January 1, 2023 (&#8220;Transferred Participants&#8221;). Prudential and RGA each irrevocably guarantee and assume the sole obligation to make future payments to the Transferred Participants as provided under their respective group annuity contracts, with direct payments beginning July 1, 2024. Prudential and RGA will each assume 50% of the benefit obligation related to Transferred Participants, except in certain jurisdictions where Prudential will assume 100% of the benefit obligation related to Transferred Participants residing in such jurisdictions. The aggregate amount of each Transferred Participant&#8217;s payment under the group annuity contracts will be equal to the amount of each individual&#8217;s payment under the Pension Plans. 

Participants in the Pension Plans who are not covered by the group annuity contracts, including management and associate retirees who commenced benefit payments on or after January 1, 2023 and active and term vested managers and associates, will not be affected by this transaction. 

Transferred Participants will continue to receive their benefits from the Pension Plans until July 1, 2024, at which time Prudential will assume responsibility for administrative services, including distribution of payments to the Transferred Participants, on behalf of itself and, where applicable, RGA. 

The purchase of the group annuity contracts was funded directly by assets of the Pension Plans. Verizon made additional contributions to the Pension Plans prior to the closing date of the transaction in the aggregate amount of approximately $365 million. With these contributions, the funded ratio of each of the Pension Plans does not change as a result of this transaction. 

As a result of the transaction, Verizon expects to recognize a one-time non-cash pension settlement credit in the first quarter of 2024. The actual amount of the credit will depend on finalization of the actuarial and other assumptions.

Attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated January 23, 2024, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated January 23, 2024, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

Verizon&#8217;s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. 

EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures 

Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. 

Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. 

Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management&#8217;s evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast are used by investors to compare a company&#8217;s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, Verizon Business Group (""Verizon Business"") goodwill impairment, asset rationalization, legal settlement, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 primarily relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Verizon Business goodwill impairment relates to an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of Verizon's annual goodwill impairment test. Asset rationalization recorded during the second quarter of 2023 relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. Asset rationalization recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily relates to Verizon Business network assets that we made a decision to cease use of as part of our continued transformation initiatives. Legal settlement recorded during 2023 relates to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees. Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio 

Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon&#8217;s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. 

Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. 

Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast 

Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. 

Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, severance, pension and benefits charges and credits, Verizon Business goodwill impairment, asset rationalization, legal settlement, business transformation costs, non-strategic business shutdown and early debt redemption costs. 

We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition&#8217;s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) 

Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the effect of special items. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2024. 

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. 

Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Special Items 

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of operating performance. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is used by investors to more accurately compare a company&#8217;s operating expenses to those of its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. In addition, the exclusion of the effects of special items allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. 

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special items: severance charges, Verizon Business goodwill impairment, asset rationalization and legal settlement.

As Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) has previously disclosed, in 2023, Verizon Business Group (Business) experienced secular declines, as well as continuing competitive and macroeconomic pressure, in wireline revenue across its customer groups. In the fourth quarter of 2023, in connection with its annual budget process, Verizon completed a comprehensive five-year strategic planning review of its Business reporting unit resulting in lower financial projections compared to the prior year five-year strategic planning cycle. The revised projections were used as a key input into the Business reporting unit&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2023. The impairment test determined that the fair value of the Business reporting unit was less than its carrying value. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Verizon recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $5.8 billion (before and after-tax), resulting in the goodwill balance of the Business reporting unit of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2023."

Verizon Communications Inc. (&#8220;Verizon&#8221;) received notice of a &#8220;mini-tender&#8221; offer by TRC Capital Investment Corporation (&#8220;TRC Capital&#8221;) and recommends that its stockholders reject the unsolicited offer. Pursuant to the offer, which is dated August 2, 2023, TRC Capital is offering to purchase up to 3 million shares of Verizon common stock at $31.95 per share (the &#8220;Offer Price&#8221;). The Offer Price is approximately 4.43% lower than the closing price of Verizon common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on August 1, 2023, the last trading day prior to the date of the offer. Verizon is not associated with TRC Capital or its &#8220;mini-tender&#8221; offer.

According to guidance on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) website, mini-tender offers &#8220;have been increasingly used to catch investors off guard&#8221; and investors &#8220;may end up selling their securities at below-market prices.&#8221; Verizon stockholders who tender their shares in the offer will receive a price below the current market price of Verizon common stock.

Mini-tender offers seek less than 5 percent of a company&#8217;s outstanding shares. This lets the offering company avoid many disclosure and procedural requirements that the SEC requires for tender offers.

Verizon urges investors to obtain current market quotes for their shares of common stock, consult with their financial advisors and exercise caution with TRC Capital&#8217;s offer. Stockholders who already tendered their shares may withdraw them by providing the written notice described in the TRC Capital offering documents before the expiration of the offer and at other times described in the offering.

Verizon requests that a copy of this 8-K be included with all distributions of materials related to TRC Capital&#8217;s offer for shares of Verizon common stock."

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special items: severance charges and asset rationalization.

Attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated April 25, 2023, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated April 25, 2023, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2023. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

Verizon&#8217;s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. 

EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures 

Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. 

Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. 

Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management&#8217;s evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast are used by investors to compare a company&#8217;s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. 

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges and net gain from disposition of business. Severance charges recorded during 2022 and 2021 relate to involuntary and voluntary separations, respectively, under our existing plans. Net gain from disposition of business relates to the sale of Verizon Media in 2021. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. 

Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio 

Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon&#8217;s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. 

Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. 

Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast 

Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. 

Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and early debt redemption costs. 

We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition&#8217;s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. 

Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) 

Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the impact of special items. 

We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. 

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. 

Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization 

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of operating performance. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization is used by investors to compare a company&#8217;s operating expenses to its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. 

Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effect of depreciation and amortization expense.

We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. 

Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, severance, pension and benefits credits, early debt redemption costs, net gain from disposition of asset and business, and loss on spectrum licenses. Severance, pension and benefits credits relate to severance charges and actuarial gains/losses resulting from the re-measurements of pension and other postretirement benefits. Net gain from disposition of asset and business relates to the sale of an investment and the sale of Verizon Media in 2021. Loss on spectrum licenses relates to the sale of certain wireless licenses in 2021. 

Actuarial gains or losses as a result of the re-measurements of pension and other postretirement benefits are included in other income and expense, net, and are measured based on projected discount rates and estimated returns on plan assets. Such estimates are updated at least annually at the end of the fiscal year to reflect actual discount rates and returns on plan assets or more frequently if significant events arise which require an interim re-measurement. 

We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition&#8217;s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition.

&#160;

On May 17, 2024, Comcast Corporation (&#8220;Comcast&#8221;) entered into a credit agreement (the &#8220;credit agreement&#8221;) among Comcast, the financial institutions party thereto (the &#8220;lenders&#8221;), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Citibank, N.A., as syndication agent, and Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Morgan Stanley MUFG Loan Partners, LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-documentation agents. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., BofA Securities, Inc., Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Morgan Stanley MUFG Loan Partners, LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. The credit agreement replaced Comcast&#8217;s prior five-year $11,000,000,000 credit agreement entered into as of March 30, 2021 (the &#8220;prior credit agreement&#8221;) among Comcast, the financial institutions party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Citibank, N.A., as syndication agent, and Bank of America, N.A., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Morgan Stanley MUFG Loan Partners, LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-documentation agents.

&#160;

The credit agreement provides for a $11,800,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the &#8220;facility&#8221;) to Comcast for general corporate purposes that is scheduled to expire on May 17, 2029 and is guaranteed by Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and NBCUniversal Media, LLC (the &#8220;guarantors&#8221;). Comcast may, upon the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders, increase the commitments under the facility up to a total of $14,800,000,000, and/or extend the expiration date of the facility to a date not later than May 17, 2031. At this time, Comcast has not borrowed any funds under the credit agreement, although certain existing letters of credit have been continued under the credit agreement and reduce the availability thereunder in a corresponding amount. Interest is based on either (i) the base rate formula, (ii) the Floating Rate formula or (iii) the fixed rate specified by the lender, each as described in the credit agreement with respect to the applicable type of borrowing. The credit agreement includes a hardwired approach for the replacement of applicable Floating Rates.

&#160;

The credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of certain liens by Comcast and certain of its subsidiaries and limitations on incurrence of certain indebtedness by certain of Comcast&#8217;s subsidiaries that are not guarantors, and a requirement that the leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter is not greater than 5.75 to 1.00. If any of the events of default occur and are not cured within any applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable and the commitments may be terminated.

&#160;

Comcast and its affiliates maintain various commercial and service relationships with certain of the lenders and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business. In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, certain of the lenders and the other parties to the credit agreement and their respective affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in commercial banking, investment banking, financial advisory or other services with Comcast and its affiliates for which they have received in the past, and/or may receive in the future, customary compensation and expense reimbursement.

On May 29, 2024, American Tower Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) completed a registered public offering of 500.0 million euros (&#8220;EUR&#8221;) aggregate principal amount of its 3.900% senior unsecured notes due 2030 (the &#8220;2030 notes&#8221;) and 500.0 million EUR aggregate principal amount of its 4.100% senior unsecured notes due 2034 (the &#8220;2034 notes&#8221; and, together with the 2030 notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), which resulted in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately 988.4 million EUR (approximately $1,074.2 million at the EUR/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.00 EUR = $1.0869, as reported by Bloomberg on May 17, 2024), after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. The Company intends to use all of the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under its $6.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021, as further amended, to the extent it has been drawn upon in EUR to, among other things, repay existing indebtedness under its 825.0 million EUR unsecured term loan, as amended in December 2021. 

The Company issued the Notes under an indenture dated as of June 1, 2022 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of May 29, 2024 (the &#8220;Supplemental Indenture No. 6&#8221; and, together with the Base Indenture, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;), among the Company, the Trustee and Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch, as paying agent. The following description of the Indenture is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Indenture. 

The 2030 notes will mature on May 16, 2030 and bear interest at a rate of 3.900% per annum. The 2034 notes will mature on May 16, 2034 and bear interest at a rate of 4.100% per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will be payable in EUR in arrears on May 16 of each year, beginning on May 16, 2025. Interest on the Notes will accrue from May 29, 2024 and will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the Notes. The terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit (a) the Company&#8217;s ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets, and (b) the Company&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; abilities to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that the Company and its subsidiaries may incur liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, provided the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens shall not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Indenture. 

The Company may redeem the Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at its election at the applicable redemption price. If the Company redeems (a) the 2030 notes prior to February 16, 2030, or (b) the 2034 notes prior to February 16, 2034, the Company shall pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If the Company redeems (a) the 2030 notes on or after February 16, 2030, or (b) the 2034 notes on or after February 16, 2034, the Company shall pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. In addition, if the Company undergoes a Change of Control and Ratings Decline, each as defined in the Indenture, the Company may be required to repurchase all of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. 

The Indenture provides that each of the following is an event of default (&#8220;Event of Default&#8221;): (i) default for 30 days in payment of any interest due with respect to the Notes; (ii) default in payment of principal or premium, if any, on the Notes when due, at maturity, upon any redemption, by declaration or otherwise; (iii) failure by the Company to comply with covenants in the Indenture or Notes for 90 days after receiving notice; and (iv) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, as defined in the Indenture. If any Event of Default arising under clause (iv) above occurs, the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the entire principal amount on all the outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. 

The foregoing is only a summary of certain provisions and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Base Indenture, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 1, 2022 as an exhibit to the Company&#8217;s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-265348), and the Supplemental Indenture No. 6, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1, and incorporated by reference herein.

On March 7, 2024, American Tower Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) completed a registered public offering of $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.200% senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the &#8220;2029 notes&#8221;) and $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.450% senior unsecured notes due 2034 (the &#8220;2034 notes&#8221; and, together with the 2029 notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), which resulted in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $1,281.3 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. The Company intends to use all of the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under its $6.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021, as further amended. 

The Company issued the Notes under an indenture dated as of June 1, 2022 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of March 7, 2024 (the &#8220;Supplemental Indenture No. 5&#8221; and, together with the Base Indenture, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;), each between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;). The following description of the Indenture is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Indenture. 

The 2029 notes will mature on February 15, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 5.200% per annum. The 2034 notes will mature on February 15, 2034 and bear interest at a rate of 5.450% per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will be payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2024. Interest on the Notes will accrue from March 7, 2024 and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit (a) the Company&#8217;s ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and (b) the Company&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; abilities to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that the Company and its subsidiaries may incur liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, provided the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens shall not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Indenture. 

The Company may redeem the Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at its election at the applicable redemption price. If the Company redeems (a) the 2029 notes prior to January 15, 2029 or (b) the 2034 notes prior to November 15, 2033, the Company shall pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If the Company redeems (a) the 2029 notes on or after January 15, 2029 or (b) the 2034 notes on or after November 15, 2033, the Company shall pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. In addition, if the Company undergoes a Change of Control and Ratings Decline, each as defined in the Indenture, the Company may be required to repurchase all of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. 

The Indenture provides that each of the following is an event of default (&#8220;Event of Default&#8221;): (i) default for 30 days in payment of any interest due with respect to the Notes; (ii) default in payment of principal or premium, if any, on the Notes when due, at maturity, upon any redemption, by declaration or otherwise; (iii) failure by the Company to comply with covenants in the Indenture or Notes for 90 days after receiving notice; and (iv) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries. If any Event of Default arising under clause (iv) above occurs, the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the entire principal amount on all the outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. 

The foregoing is only a summary of certain provisions and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Base Indenture, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 1, 2022 as an exhibit to the Company&#8217;s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-265348), and the Supplemental Indenture No. 5, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1, and incorporated by reference herein.

The Committee also approved an equity grant for Mr. Vondran, with an award value of $10 million pursuant to the Company&#8217;s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended. The award value for Mr. Vondran is allocated 70% to performance-based restricted stock units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;) and 30% to restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;). Each PSU grant is based on a three-year performance period, with the performance goals set at the beginning of the performance period. Each RSU grant vests 1/3rd annually over three years, commencing one year from the date of grant. The number of shares subject to each of these awards will be determined using the closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on March 11, 2024. 

The Committee also determined that compensation for Thomas A. Bartlett, advisor to the Chief Executive Officer, will remain unchanged from the compensation approved for his previous role by the Committee on February 24, 2023. Mr. Bartlett will be eligible to earn a bonus for 2024, pro-rated for his length of service in 2024, and did not receive an equity grant for 2024."

On September 15, 2023, American Tower Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) completed a registered public offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.800% senior unsecured notes due 2028 (the &#8220;2028 notes&#8221;) and $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.900% senior unsecured notes due 2033 (the &#8220;2033 notes&#8221; and, together with the 2028 notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), which resulted in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $1,482.8 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. The Company intends to use all of the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under its $6.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021, as further amended. 

The Company issued the Notes under an indenture dated as of June 1, 2022 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of September 15, 2023 (the &#8220;Supplemental Indenture No. 4&#8221; and, together with the Base Indenture, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;), each between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;). The following description of the Indenture is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Indenture. 

The 2028 notes will mature on November 15, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 5.800% per annum. The 2033 notes will mature on November 15, 2033 and bear interest at a rate of 5.900% per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will be payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2024. Interest on the Notes will accrue from September 15, 2023 and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit (a) the Company&#8217;s ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and (b) the Company&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; abilities to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that the Company and its subsidiaries may incur liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, provided the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens shall not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Indenture. 

The Company may redeem the Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at its election at the applicable redemption price. If the Company redeems (a) the 2028 notes prior to October 15, 2028 or (b) the 2033 notes prior to August 15, 2033, the Company shall pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If the Company redeems (a) the 2028 notes on or after October 15, 2028 or (b) the 2033 notes on or after August 15, 2033, the Company shall pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. In addition, if the Company undergoes a Change of Control and Ratings Decline, each as defined in the Indenture, the Company may be required to repurchase all of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. 

The Indenture provides that each of the following is an event of default (&#8220;Event of Default&#8221;): (i) default for 30 days in payment of any interest due with respect to the Notes; (ii) default in payment of principal or premium, if any, on the Notes when due, at maturity, upon any redemption, by declaration or otherwise; (iii) failure by the Company to comply with covenants in the Indenture or Notes for 90 days after receiving notice; and (iv) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries. If any Event of Default arising under clause (iv) above occurs, the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the entire principal amount on all the outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. 

The foregoing is only a summary of certain provisions and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Base Indenture, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 1, 2022 as an exhibit to the Company&#8217;s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-265348), and the Supplemental Indenture No. 4, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1, and incorporated by reference herein.

On March 13, 2023, American Tower Trust I (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;), a trust established in May 2007 by American Tower Depositor Sub, LLC (the &#8220;Depositor&#8221;), an indirectly-owned special-purpose subsidiary of the Company, issued, in a private transaction (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;), $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2023-1, Subclass A (the &#8220;Series 2023-1A Securities&#8221;). The proceeds of the issuance of the Series 2023-1A Securities were loaned to the Borrowers pursuant to the Loan Agreement (each as defined below). The Company used the net proceeds from this issuance to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. 

To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Risk Retention Rules&#8221;), the Trust issued, and an affiliate of the Company purchased, $68.5 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2023-1, Subclass R (the &#8220;Series 2023-1R Securities&#8221; and, together with the Series 2023-1A Securities, the &#8220;Securities&#8221;) to retain an &#8220;eligible horizontal residual interest&#8221; (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the Securities. 

The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse componentized loan (the &#8220;Loan&#8221;) made by the Trust to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the &#8220;Borrowers&#8221;) pursuant to the Second Supplement and Amendment dated as of March 13, 2023 to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 29, 2018 (collectively, the &#8220;Loan Agreement&#8221;), in each case, among the foregoing parties. The Borrowers are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the Borrowers&#8217; interests in certain wireless communications and related tower sites (the &#8220;Sites&#8221;). 

The Securities issued by the Trust correspond to components of the Loan made to the Borrowers. As indicated in the table below, the Securities were issued in two separate Subclasses of the same Series. The Securities represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the Securities. The initial principal balances and the interest rates with respect to the components of the Loan corresponding to the Securities are set forth below. The Securities have an expected life of approximately five years with a final repayment date in March 2053. 

Subclass Initial Class Principal Balance Interest Rate Rating (Moody's/Fitch) Series 2023-1A $1,300,000,000.00 5.490 % Aaa(sf)/AAA(sf) Series 2023-1R $68,500,000.00 5.735 % N/A 

The debt service on the Loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated from the operation of the Sites held by the Borrowers. The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Loan. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made on the components of the Loan corresponding to the Securities prior to the monthly payment date in March 2028, which is the anticipated repayment date for such components. If the debt service coverage ratio, which is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months on the Loan, is 1.30x or less for any quarter (the &#8220;Cash Trap DSCR&#8221;), then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the 

Borrowers. The funds in the reserve account will not be released to the Borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. An &#8220;amortization period&#8221; commences if (i) as of the end of any calendar quarter, the debt service coverage ratio is equal to or below 1.15x (the &#8220;Minimum DSCR&#8221;) for such calendar quarter and continues to exist until the debt service coverage ratio exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters or (ii) on an anticipated repayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable Subclass of the Securities has not been repaid in full. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow will be applied to prepay the principal of the Loan. 

The Borrowers may prepay the Loan at any time provided it is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within twelve months of the anticipated repayment date for the Securities, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the components of the Loan corresponding to the Securities will be due in March 2053. 

The Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the Borrowers&#8217; personal property and fixtures and (3) the Borrowers&#8217; rights under the Management Agreement (as defined below). American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the &#8220;Guarantor&#8221;), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the Borrowers, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations. 

The Loan documents include covenants customary for Loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The organizational documents of the Borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. 

Pursuant to the First Amended and Restated Management Agreement (the &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;) dated as of March 15, 2013, among the Borrowers, as owners, and SpectraSite Communications, LLC (&#8220;SpectraSite Communications&#8221;), as manager (in that capacity, &#8220;Manager&#8221;), the Manager will perform, on behalf of the Borrowers, those functions reasonably necessary to maintain, market, operate, manage and administer the Sites. SpectraSite Communications is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company. 

In connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Borrowers, as borrowers, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association) (&#8220;Trustee&#8221;), as trustee and agent, Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association (&#8220;Servicer&#8221;), as servicer, and SpectraSite Communications, as manager, entered into a First Amendment dated as of March 13, 2023 to the Second Amended and Restated Cash Management Agreement dated as of March 29, 2018 (collectively, the &#8220;Cash Management Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Cash Management Agreement, the Borrowers have established certain accounts and reserves, controlled by the lender, or its assignee, to which the Borrowers and the Manager will be required to transfer all revenue from the Sites otherwise received. The Borrowers, Manager and Trustee will administer the reserve funds in the manner set forth in the Loan Agreement. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Depositor, the Servicer and Trustee entered into a Second Trust Agreement Supplement and Amendment dated as of March 13, 2023 to the Second Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement dated as of March 29, 2018 (collectively, the &#8220;Trust and Servicing Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Trust and Servicing Agreement, the Servicer will administer and oversee the performance by the Borrowers and the Manager of their respective obligations under the documents entered into in connection with the Transaction. 

The Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1A and the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1R, each issued pursuant to the Trust and Servicing Agreement in March 2018, remain outstanding and are subject to the terms of the Trust and Servicing Agreement. 

The foregoing is only a summary of certain provisions of the Loan and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Management Agreement, the Cash Management Agreement and the Trust and 

Servicing Agreement. Copies of the Loan Agreement, the Cash Management Agreement and the Trust and Servicing Agreement will be filed as exhibits to the Company&#8217;s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023."

On March 3, 2023, American Tower Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) completed a registered public offering of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500% senior unsecured notes due 2028 (the &#8220;2028 notes&#8221;) and $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.650% senior unsecured notes due 2033 (the &#8220;2033 notes&#8221; and, together with the 2028 notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), which resulted in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $1,480.9 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. The Company intends to use all of the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under (i) its $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021, and (ii) its $6.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021. 

The Company issued the Notes under an indenture dated as of June 1, 2022 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of March 3, 2023 (the &#8220;Supplemental Indenture No. 1&#8221; and, together with the Base Indenture, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;), each between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;). The following description of the Indenture is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Indenture. 

The 2028 notes will mature on March 15, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per annum. The 2033 notes will mature on March 15, 2033 and bear interest at a rate of 5.650% per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will be payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2023. Interest on the Notes will accrue from March 3, 2023 and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit the Company&#8217;s ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and the Company&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; abilities to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that the Company and its subsidiaries may incur liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, provided the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens shall not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Indenture. 

The Company may redeem the Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at its election at the applicable redemption price. If the Company redeems the 2028 notes prior to February 15, 2028 or the 2033 notes prior to December 15, 2032, the Company will pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If the Company redeems the 2028 notes on or after February 15, 2028 or the 2033 notes on or after December 15, 2032, the Company will pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. In addition, if the Company undergoes a Change of Control and Ratings Decline, each as defined in the Indenture, the Company may be required to repurchase all of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. 

The Indenture provides that each of the following is an event of default (&#8220;Event of Default&#8221;): (i) default for 30 days in payment of any interest due with respect to the Notes; (ii) default in payment of principal or premium, if any, on the Notes when due, at maturity, upon any redemption, by declaration or otherwise; (iii) failure by the Company to comply with covenants in the Indenture or Notes for 90 days after receiving notice; and (iv) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries. If any Event of Default arising under clause (iv) above occurs, the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the entire principal amount on all the outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. 

The foregoing is only a summary of certain provisions and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Base Indenture, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 1, 2022 as an exhibit to the Company&#8217;s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-265348), and the Supplemental Indenture No. 1, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1, and incorporated by reference herein.

&#160; 

On July 18, 2024, the Operating Partnership priced an offering of $700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.000% Notes due 2035 (the &#8220;2035 Notes&#8221;) and an additional $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.250% Notes due 2054 (the &#8220;2054 Notes&#8221; and, together with the 2035 Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). In connection with the offering, the Operating Partnership entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated July 18, 2024 (the &#8220;Underwriting Agreement&#8221;), with BofA Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc. and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule A thereto (the &#8220;Underwriters&#8221;), pursuant to which the Operating Partnership agreed to sell and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth therein. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference. 

&#160; 

The 2054 Notes constitute a further issuance of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s 5.250% Notes due 2054, of which $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount was issued on January 25, 2024 (the &#8220;Existing 2054 Notes&#8221;). The 2054 Notes will form a single series with, and have the same terms as, the Existing 2054 Notes (other than the initial offering price and the issue date). Upon settlement, the 2054 Notes will have the same CUSIP/ISIN number and will trade interchangeably with the Existing 2054 Notes. Immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the 2054 Notes, the Operating Partnership will have $850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.250% Notes due 2054 outstanding. 

&#160; 

The Notes are being issued under an indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), among Prologis, Inc. (the &#8220;Parent&#8221;), the Operating Partnership and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture, dated as of August 15, 2013 (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;). 

&#160; 

The net proceeds to the Operating Partnership from the sale of the Notes, after the Underwriters&#8217; discount and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. The Operating Partnership intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under the U.S. Dollar tranches of its global lines of credit. 

&#160; 

The 2035 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.000% per annum and mature on January 31, 2035. The 2054 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.250% per annum and mature on March 15, 2054. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership. 

&#160; 

The 2035 Notes and the 2054 Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Operating Partnership, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed that would be due if such Notes matured on October 31, 2034, in the case of the 2035 Notes, or September 15, 2053, in the case of the 2054 Notes (each, the &#8220;Applicable Par Call Date&#8221; as to the applicable series of Notes) (in each case exclusive of interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points, in the case of the 2035 Notes, and 15 basis points, in the case of the 2054 Notes. In addition, on or after the Applicable Par Call Date, each series of Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Operating Partnership&#8217;s option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes to be redeemed. In each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid on the Notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Indenture governing the Notes restricts, among other things, the Operating Partnership&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to incur additional indebtedness and to merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its assets. 

&#160; 

The Notes are being issued pursuant to the Registration Statement (File No. 333-267431) that the Operating Partnership, the Parent and certain of their wholly-owned subsidiaries filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Operating Partnership, the Parent and certain of their wholly-owned subsidiaries pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with filing with the SEC a definitive prospectus supplement, dated July 18, 2024, and base prospectus, dated September 15, 2022, relating to the public offering of the Notes, the Operating Partnership is filing the Underwriting Agreement, the form of the Notes and certain other exhibits with this Current Report on Form 8-K as exhibits to such Registration Statement.

&#160;

The net proceeds to the Operating Partnership from the sale of the Sterling Notes, after the Underwriter&#8217;s discounts and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately &#163;346 million, or $430 million, based on the sterling/U.S. dollar rate of exchange as of April 12, 2024.

In each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid on the Sterling Notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

On January 16, 2024, the Talent and Compensation Committee (the &#8220;Compensation Committee&#8221;) of the Board of Directors of Prologis, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) approved a new form of Performance Stock Unit Agreement (the &#8220;PSU Agreement&#8221;) to be used to grant equity awards under the Company&#8217;s 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Commencing with the 2024 performance year, the Compensation Committee will make no new awards to our chief executive officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;), chief financial officer, president, chief legal officer, chief operating officer or chief investment officer (collectively, the &#8220;Applicable Officers&#8221;) under the Prologis, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 2018 Outperformance Plan (which we generally refer to as &#8220;POP&#8221;). Instead, the Compensation Committee intends to grant each of the Applicable Officers an annual equity award, which in the case of our CEO will be 100% conditioned on performance and, in the case of the other Applicable Officers, will be 80% conditioned on performance and 20% conditioned on continued service to the Company. The performance-based component of the Applicable Officers&#8217; equity awards will be granted pursuant to the terms of the PSU Agreement. Awards granted to the Applicable Officers under the PSU Agreement for the 2024 performance year will utilize a performance scale based on the Company&#8217;s percentile ranking in the MSCI U.S. REIT Index (the &#8220;Index&#8221;) for the January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026 period (the &#8220;Three-year Performance Vesting Period&#8221;) and thereafter, if earned, will be subject to an additional two-year time vesting period as set forth in the PSU Agreement and a three-year lock-up following the Three-year Performance Vesting Period. Awards will range from 0% of target (in the event the Company is ranked below the 35 th

percentile of the Index) to 200% of target (if the Company is ranked in the 85 th

percentile of the Index or above), with target (100%) award value requiring the Company to be ranked in the 55 th

percentile of the Index and threshold (50% of target) award value requiring the Company to be ranked in the 35 th

percentile of the Index. The service-based component of equity awards granted to the non-CEO

Applicable Officers will vest ratably over a four-year period and will be conditioned on continued service to the Company

. 

The Compensation Committee also approved a form of amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Prologis Promote Plan (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) for the purpose of reducing the Bonus Pool (as defined in PPP) for awards made under PPP from 40 percent of Incentive Fees (as defined in PPP) to 25 percent of Incentive Fees.

On August 25, 2023, Prologis Marunouchi Finance Investment Limited Partnership, a Japanese toshi jigyo yugen sekinin kumiai and a subsidiary of Prologis, Inc. (&#8220;Prologis&#8221;), as the initial borrower, and Prologis, L.P. (&#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), as guarantor, entered into the Seventh Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the &#8220;Yen Revolver&#8221;) with various lenders and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as Administrative Agent. Pursuant to the Yen Revolver, the borrowers thereunder may obtain loans and/or procure the issuance of letters of credit on a revolving basis in an aggregate amount not exceeding JPY58.5 billion. The Operating Partnership may increase the availability under the Yen Revolver to an amount not exceeding JPY75.0 billion by adding additional lenders to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing lenders to increase their commitments.

&#160;

The Yen Revolver is scheduled to mature on August 25, 2027, but the Operating Partnership may, at its option and subject to payment of an extension fee, extend the maturity date of the Yen Revolver for one year (to August 25, 2028). Pricing under the Yen Revolver, including the spread over TIBOR and the rates applicable to facility fees and letter of credit fees, varies based upon the public debt ratings of the Operating Partnership as in effect from time to time. As of the closing date, the spread was 34 basis points. The Yen Revolver contains customary representations, covenants (including certain financial tests applicable to the Operating Partnership) and defaults (including a cross-acceleration to other recourse indebtedness of more than USD150,000,000).

&#160;

Concurrently with the effectiveness of the Yen Revolver, Prologis Japan Finance Investment Limited Partnership and the Operating Partnership became borrowers under the Yen Revolver pursuant to joinder agreements. Additional subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership may become borrowers under the Yen Revolver from time to time. The Operating Partnership has unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of each other borrower under the Yen Revolver. Pursuant to the terms of the Yen Revolver, Prologis is not required to guarantee the obligations of the borrowers under the Yen Revolver unless Prologis incurs any indebtedness that is not in existence as of the date of the Yen Revolver or guarantees any indebtedness that is not guaranteed by Prologis as of the date of the Yen Revolver.

On June 26, 2023, the Operating Partnership priced an offering of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.875% Notes due 2028 (the &#8220;2028 Notes&#8221;), $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% Notes due 2034 (the &#8220;2034 Notes&#8221;) and an additional $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.250% Notes due 2053 (the &#8220;2053 Notes,&#8221; together with the 2028 Notes and the 2034 Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). In connection with the offering, the Operating Partnership entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated June 26, 2023 (the &#8220;Underwriting Agreement&#8221;), with BofA Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs &#38; Co.

The Notes are being issued under an indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), among Prologis, Inc. (the &#8220;Parent&#8221;), the Operating Partnership and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture, dated as of August 15, 2013 (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;).

&#160;

The net proceeds to the Operating Partnership from the sale of the Notes, after the Underwriters&#8217; discount and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately $1.97 billion. The Operating Partnership intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes for general corporate purposes, including to fund a portion of the acquisition of real estate assets announced on June 26, 2023 and the repayment of any borrowings under the Operating Partnership&#8217;s global lines of credit for the closing of the acquisition.

&#160;

The 2028 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.875% per annum and mature on June 15, 2028. The 2034 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.125% per annum and mature on January 15, 2034. The 2053 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.250% per annum and mature on June 15, 2053. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership. 

&#160;

The 2028 Notes, the 2034 Notes, and the 2053 Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Operating Partnership, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed that would be due if such Notes matured on May 15, 2028, in the case of the 2028 Notes, October 15, 2033, in the case of the 2034 Notes, and December 15, 2052, in the case of the 2053 Notes (each, the &#8220;Applicable Par Call Date&#8221; as to the applicable series of Notes) (in each case exclusive of interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points, in the case of the 2028 Notes, 25 basis points, in the case of the 2034 Notes, and 25 basis points, in the case of the 2053 Notes. In addition, on or after the Applicable Par Call Date, each series of Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Operating Partnership&#8217;s option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes to be redeemed. In each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid on the Notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Indenture governing the Notes restricts, among other things, the Operating Partnership&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to incur additional indebtedness and to merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its assets.

&#160;

The Notes are being issued pursuant to the Registration Statement (File No. 333-267431) that the Operating Partnership, the Parent and certain of their wholly-owned subsidiaries filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Operating Partnership, the Parent and certain of their wholly-owned subsidiaries pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with filing with the SEC a definitive prospectus supplement, dated June 26, 2023, and base prospectus, dated September 15, 2022, relating to the public offering of the Notes, the Operating Partnership is filing the Underwriting Agreement, the form of the Notes and certain other exhibits with this Current Report on Form 8-K as exhibits to such Registration Statement.

&#160;

On May 16, 2023, the Company priced an offering of &#8364;750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.625% Notes due 2033 (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). In connection with the offering, the Company and Prologis, L.P. (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;) entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated May 16, 2023 (the &#8220;Underwriting Agreement&#8221;), with BNP Paribas, Cr&#233;dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, ING Bank N.V. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc and the other underwriters named in Schedule A thereto (the &#8220;Underwriters&#8221;), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth therein. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

The Notes are being issued under an indenture dated as of August 1, 2018 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), among the Company, the Operating Partnership and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated as of August 1, 2018 (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;).

&#160;

The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Notes, after the Underwriter&#8217;s discounts and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately &#8364;742 million, or $805 million, based on the euro/U.S. dollar rate of exchange as of May 12, 2023. The Company intends to lend or distribute the net proceeds from the Notes to the Operating Partnership or one of its other subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership expects to use a portion of such net proceeds to repay borrowings under the Euro tranches of its global lines of credit and the remainder for general corporate purposes, including to repay, repurchase or tender for other indebtedness.

&#160;

The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.625% per annum and mature on May 23, 2033. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.

&#160;

The Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed that would be due if such Notes matured on February 23, 2033 (the &#8220;Par Call Date&#8221;) (in each case exclusive of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis at the applicable Comparable Government Rate Bond plus 35 basis points. In addition, on or after the Par Call Date, the Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company&#8217;s option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed. In each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid on the Notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

&#160;

The Indenture governing the Notes restricts, among other things, the Operating Partnership&#8217;s and its subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness and to merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its assets.

&#160;

The Notes are being issued pursuant to the Registration Statement (File No. 333-267431) that the Company and the Operating Partnership filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Company and the Operating Partnership pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with filing with the SEC a definitive prospectus supplement, dated May 16, 2023, and base prospectus, dated September 15, 2022, relating to the public offering of the Notes and corresponding guarantees, the Company and the Operating Partnership are filing the Underwriting Agreement, the form of the Notes and certain other exhibits with this Current Report on Form 8-K as exhibits to such Registration Statement.

Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. 

On April 5, 2023, Prologis, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), and various affiliates of the Operating Partnership entered into an Amended and Restated Global Senior Credit Agreement (the &#8220;2023 Global Facility&#8221;) with various lenders and agents, and Bank of America, N.A., as Global Administrative Agent, which amends and restates the Global Senior Credit Agreement dated as of April 15, 2021 among the Operating Partnership, various affiliates of the Operating Partnership, the various agents and lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Global Administrative Agent. Pursuant to the 2023 Global Facility, the Operating Partnership and various affiliates thereof (collectively the &#8220;Borrowers&#8221;) may obtain loans and/or procure the issuance of letters of credit in various currencies on a revolving basis in an aggregate amount not exceeding the U.S. Dollar equivalent of approximately $3,000,000,000 (subject to increase by not more than the U.S. Dollar equivalent of $1,000,000,000 (determined as of the effective date of such increase) pursuant to the accordion feature included in the 2023 Global Facility). As of the closing date, the 2023 Global Facility has two tranches: (i) a U.S. Dollar Tranche in the amount of $2,000,000,000 and (ii) a Euro Tranche in the amount of &#8364;917,094,644.17. 

The 2023 Global Facility is scheduled to mature on June 30, 2027, but the Operating Partnership may, at its option and subject to payment of an extension fee, extend the maturity date of the 2023 Global Facility for six months on two occasions (to December 30, 2027 and June 30, 2028, respectively). Pricing under the 2023 Global Facility, including the spread over the applicable benchmark rate and the rates applicable to facility fees and letter of credit fees, varies based upon the public debt ratings of the Operating Partnership as in effect from time to time. As of the closing date, the spread was 69 basis points. The 2023 Global Facility contains customary representations, covenants (including certain financial tests applicable to the Operating Partnership) and defaults (including a cross-acceleration to other recourse indebtedness of more than $150,000,000). The Operating Partnership has unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of each other borrower under the 2023 Global Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Global Facility, Prologis, Inc. is not required to guarantee the obligations of the borrowers under the 2023 Global Facility unless Prologis, Inc. incurs any indebtedness that is not in existence as of the date of the 2023 Global Facility or guarantees any indebtedness that is not guaranteed by Prologis, Inc. as of the date of the 2023 Global Facility. 

The 2023 Global Facility has been included herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

On March 23, 2023, the Operating Partnership priced an offering of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.750% Notes due 2033 (the &#8220;2033 Notes&#8221;) and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.250% Notes due 2053 (the &#8220;2053 Notes&#8221; and, together with the 2033 Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). In connection with the offering, the Operating Partnership entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated March 23, 2023 (the &#8220;Underwriting Agreement&#8221;), with BofA Securities, Inc., PNC Capital Markets LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and the other underwriters named in Schedule A thereto (the &#8220;Underwriters&#8221;), pursuant to which the Operating Partnership agreed to sell and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth therein. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

The Notes are being issued under an indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), among Prologis, Inc. (the &#8220;Parent&#8221;), the Operating Partnership and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture, dated as of August 15, 2013 (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the fifth supplemental indenture, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;).

&#160;

The net proceeds to the Operating Partnership from the sale of the Notes, after the Underwriters&#8217; discount and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately $1.2 billion. The Operating Partnership intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes for general corporate purposes, including to repay or repurchase other indebtedness or manage other capital needs. In the short term, the Operating Partnership may also use the amounts received from the Notes to repay borrowings under its global line of credit.

&#160;

The 2033 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.750% per annum and mature on June 15, 2033. The 2053 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.250% per annum and mature on June 15, 2053. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership. 

&#160;

The 2033 Notes and the 2053 Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the option of the Operating Partnership, at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed that would be due if such Notes matured on March 15, 2033, in the case of the 2033 Notes, or December 15, 2052, in the case of the 2053 Notes (each, the &#8220;Applicable Par Call Date&#8221; as to the applicable series of Notes) (in each case exclusive of interest accrued to the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date, on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus 25 basis points, in the case of the 2033 Notes, and 25 basis points, in the case of the 2053 Notes. In addition, on or after the Applicable Par Call Date, each series of Notes will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Operating Partnership&#8217;s option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes to be redeemed. In each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid on the Notes being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

&#160;

The Indenture governing the Notes restricts, among other things, the Operating Partnership&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to incur additional indebtedness and to merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its assets.

&#160;

The Notes are being issued pursuant to the Registration Statement (File No. 333-267431) that the Operating Partnership, the Parent and certain of their wholly-owned subsidiaries filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Operating Partnership, the Parent and certain of their wholly-owned subsidiaries pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with filing with the SEC a definitive prospectus supplement, dated March 23, 2023, and base prospectus, dated September 15, 2022, relating to the public offering of the Notes, the Operating Partnership is filing the Underwriting Agreement, the form of the Notes and certain other exhibits with this Current Report on Form 8-K as exhibits to such Registration Statement.

&#160;

On January 23, 2023, the Company priced an offering of &#8364;600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.875% Notes due 2030 (the &#8220;2030 Notes&#8221;) and &#8364;650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.250% Notes due 2043 (the &#8220;2043 Notes&#8221; and, together with the 2030 Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). In connection with the offering, the Company and Prologis, L.P.

The Company intends to lend or distribute the net proceeds from the Notes to the Operating Partnership or one of its other subsidiaries.

&#160;

On November 17, 2022 the Company priced an offering of (i) &#165;1,600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.003% Notes due 2027 (the &#8220;2027 Notes&#8221;), (ii) &#165;2,800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.323% Notes due 2029 (the &#8220;2029 Notes&#8221;) and (iii) &#165;19,800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.903% Notes due 2037 (the &#8220;2037 Notes&#8221; and, collectively with the 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). In connection with the offering, the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated November 17, 2022 (the &#8220;Underwriting Agreement&#8221;), with Mizuho Securities USA LLC, MUFG Securities EMEA plc and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. (the &#8220;Underwriters&#8221;), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth therein. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

The Notes are being issued under an indenture, dated September 25, 2018 (the &#8220;Base Indenture&#8221;), among the Company, the Operating Partnership and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, dated September 25, 2018 (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;).

&#160;

The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Notes, after the Underwriter&#8217;s discount and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately &#165;23.9 billion, or $168.9 million, based on the yen/U.S. dollar rate of exchange as of November 10 , 2022. The Company intends to lend or distribute the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to the Operating Partnership, who intends to use the amounts received for general corporate purposes, including to repay or repurchase indebtedness or manage other capital needs. In the short term, the Operating Partnership may also use the amounts received to repay borrowings under its Japanese yen revolving credit agreement.

&#160;

The 2027 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 1.003% per annum and mature on December 1, 2027. The 2029 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 1.323% per annum and mature on November 30, 2029. The 2037 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 1.903% per annum and mature on December 1, 2037. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.

&#160;

On or after November 1, 2027 for the 2027 Notes (one month prior to the maturity date), September 30, 2029 for the 2029 Notes (two months prior to the maturity date), and September 1, 2037 for the 2037 Notes (three months prior to the maturity date), such series of Notes will be redeemable in whole or in part, at the Company&#8217;s option, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the series of Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the principal amount being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date.

&#160;

The Company may also redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, in the event of certain developments affecting tax law in the United States (or any taxing authority thereof or therein) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.

&#160;

The Indenture governing the Notes restricts, among other things, the Operating Partnership&#8217;s and its subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness and to merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its assets.

&#160;

The Notes are being issued pursuant to the Registration Statement (File No. 333-267431) that the Company and the Operating Partnership filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Company and the Operating Partnership pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with filing with the SEC a definitive prospectus supplement, dated November 17, 2022, and base prospectus, dated September 15, 2022, relating to the public offering of the Notes and corresponding guarantees, the Company and the Operating Partnership are filing the Underwriting Agreement with this Current Report as an exhibit to such Registration Statement. See &#8220;Item 9.01 &#8211; Financial Statements and Exhibits.&#8221;

&#160;

Additionally, attached hereto as exhibit 5.2 is the opinion of Mayer Brown LLP with respect to the registration of the resale certain shares of common stock of Prologis Inc.

&#160;

&#160;

This Current Report does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

On May 10, 2024, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (&#8220; Pioneer &#8221;), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation, a New Jersey corporation (the &#8220; Company &#8221;), issued a notice (the &#8220; Redemption Notice &#8221;) to holders of Pioneer&#8217;s 0.250% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the &#8220; Notes &#8221;) calling for redemption (the &#8220; Redemption &#8221;) of all outstanding Notes that have not been submitted for conversion. A copy of the Redemption Notice is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference into this Item 8.01.

&#160;

On June 25, 2024 (the &#8220; Redemption Date &#8221;), all then-outstanding Notes that have not been submitted for conversion will be repurchased for cash at a price (the &#8220; Redemption Price &#8221;) equal to the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, which equates to a Redemption Price of $1,000.28 per $1,000 principal amount of each Note.

&#160;

Notes (or any portion thereof having a principal amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000) that are called for Redemption may be submitted for conversion at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on June 21, 2024, which is the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the Redemption Date (the &#8220; Redemption Period &#8221;). Notes that are converted during the Redemption Period will be settled in cash based on the conversion rate. As of the date of the Redemption Notice, the conversion rate of the Notes is 25.4503 shares of common stock, without par value, of the Company (&#8220; Company Common Stock &#8221;) per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $39.29 per share of Company Common Stock.

This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute a redemption notice and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Redemption Notice.

On May 3, 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation, a New Jersey corporation (the &#8220; Company &#8221;), consummated the previously announced acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Company, a Delaware corporation (&#8220; Pioneer &#8221;), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8221;) dated as of October 10, 2023, among the Company, Pioneer and SPQR, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220; Merger Sub &#8221;). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into Pioneer, with Pioneer continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the &#8220; Merger &#8221;).

&#160;

At the effective time and as a result of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Pioneer (&#8220; Pioneer common stock &#8221;), outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than certain excluded shares held by Pioneer as treasury stock or owned by the Company or Merger Sub, was canceled and automatically converted into the right to receive 2.3234 shares of common stock, without par value, of the Company (&#8220; Company common stock &#8221;), together with cash proceeds from the sale of fractional shares (the &#8220; Merger Consideration &#8221;).

&#160;

At the effective time of the Merger, each Pioneer restricted stock unit (each, a &#8220; Pioneer RSU &#8221;) (whether vested or unvested, other than those granted on or after October 10, 2023 that remained unvested as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger), each Pioneer restricted stock unit issued by Pioneer to a non-employee member of the Pioneer board of directors (each, a &#8220; Pioneer DSU &#8221;) (whether vested or unvested) and each Pioneer performance stock unit (each, a &#8220; Pioneer Performance Unit &#8221;) (whether vested or unvested) outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was, without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Pioneer or the holder thereof, canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the total number of shares of Pioneer common stock subject to each respective Pioneer RSU, Pioneer DSU and Pioneer Performance Unit (with the number of shares of Pioneer common stock subject to each Pioneer Performance Unit determined based on the maximum level of performance), subject to applicable tax withholding. Additionally, each share of restricted Pioneer common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger became fully vested, Pioneer withheld a number of such shares necessary to satisfy any tax withholding, and the remainder of such shares was converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Each Pioneer RSU granted on or after October 10, 2023 that was outstanding and remained unvested as of immediately prior to the effective time was converted into a number of Company restricted stock units equal to the Merger Consideration, multiplied by the total number of shares of Pioneer common stock subject to such Pioneer RSU.

Supplemental Indenture 

&#160;

In connection with the completion of the Merger, on May 3, 2024, the Company, Pioneer and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association), as trustee, entered into the First Supplemental Indenture to that certain Indenture (the &#8220; Indenture &#8221;), dated as of May 14, 2020, pursuant to which Pioneer issued 0.250% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the &#8220; Notes &#8221;). The First Supplemental Indenture provides that, as of the effective time of the Merger, the right of the holders of the Notes that were outstanding as of the completion of the Merger to convert each $1,000 principal amount of such Notes into shares of Pioneer common stock was changed into a right to convert such principal amount of Notes into the number of shares of Company common stock that a holder of a number of shares of Pioneer common stock equal to the Conversion Rate (as defined in the Indenture) immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger would have been entitled to receive upon the completion of the Merger; provided that, at and after the effective time of the Merger (A) Pioneer will continue to have the right to determine the form of consideration to be paid or delivered, as the case may be, upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and (B) any amount payable in cash upon conversion of the Notes in accordance the terms of the Indenture will continue to be payable in cash. As described above, upon the completion of the Merger, each then-outstanding share of Pioneer common stock was converted into the right to receive 2.3234 shares of Company common stock, resulting in an adjusted initial Conversion Rate of 25.4503 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. As of the date hereof, approximately $450 million aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding.

&#160;

As previously disclosed, on October 10, 2023, Exxon Mobil Corporation, a New Jersey corporation (the &#8220; Company &#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8221;) by and among the Company, Pioneer Natural Resources Company, a Delaware corporation (&#8220; Pioneer &#8221;), and SPQR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220; Merger Sub &#8221;). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Pioneer (the &#8220; Merger &#8221;), with Pioneer surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

&#160;

On December 4, 2023, the Company and Pioneer each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (a &#8220; Second Request &#8221;) from the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220; FTC &#8221;) in connection with the FTC&#8217;s review of the Merger. The effect of a Second Request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the &#8220; HSR Act &#8221;), until 30 days after each of the Company and Pioneer has substantially complied with the Second Request issued to it, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the FTC. Completion of the Merger remains subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement.

&#160;

The Company and Pioneer continue to work constructively with the FTC in its review of the Merger and continue to expect that the Merger will be completed in the first half of 2024, subject to the fulfillment of the closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval of Pioneer&#8217;s stockholders.

&#160;

Important Information about the Merger and Where to Find It 

&#160;

In connection with the Merger between the Company and Pioneer, the Company and Pioneer have filed and will file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220; SEC &#8221;). On November 21, 2023, the Company filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (the &#8220; Form S-4 &#8221;) to register the shares of the Company common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger. The Form S-4 includes a proxy statement of Pioneer that also constitutes a prospectus of the Company. The information in the Form S-4 is not complete and may be changed. After the Form S-4 is declared effective, a definitive proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to stockholders of Pioneer. This communication is not a substitute for the Form S-4, proxy statement or prospectus or any other document that the Company or Pioneer (as applicable) has filed or may file with the SEC in connection with the Merger. BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING OR INVESTMENT DECISION, INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY AND PIONEER ARE URGED TO READ THE FORM S-4, THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE FILED OR WILL BE FILED WITH THE SEC, AS WELL AS ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS TO THESE DOCUMENTS, CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN OR WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE MERGER AND RELATED MATTERS. Investors and security holders may obtain free copies of the Form S-4 and the proxy statement/prospectus, as well as other filings containing important information about the Company or Pioneer, without charge at the SEC&#8217;s Internet website (http://www.sec.gov).

&#160;

This communication is for informational purposes and is not intended to, and shall not, constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

Forward-Looking Statements 

&#160;

This communication contains &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In this context, forward-looking statements often address future business and financial events, conditions, expectations, plans or ambitions, and often contain words such as &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;see,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words, but not all forward-looking statements include such words. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the consummation of the Merger and the anticipated benefits thereof. All such forward-looking statements are based upon current plans, estimates, expectations and ambitions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company and Pioneer, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: the completion of the Merger on anticipated terms and timing, or at all, including obtaining regulatory approvals that may be required on anticipated terms and Pioneer stockholder approval; anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the combined company&#8217;s operations and other conditions to the completion of the Merger, including the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of the Merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the ability of the Company and Pioneer to integrate the business successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies and value creation; potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against the Company, Pioneer or their respective directors; the risk that disruptions from the Merger will harm the Company&#8217;s or Pioneer&#8217;s business, including current plans and operations and that management&#8217;s time and attention will be diverted on transaction-related issues; potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the Merger; rating agency actions and the Company and Pioneer&#8217;s ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; legislative, regulatory and economic developments, including regulatory actions targeting public companies in the oil and gas industry and changes in local, national, or international laws, regulations, and policies affecting the Company and Pioneer including with respect to the environment; potential business uncertainty, including the outcome of commercial negotiations and changes to existing business relationships during the pendency of the Merger that could affect the Company&#8217;s and/or Pioneer&#8217;s financial performance and operating results; certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact Pioneer&#8217;s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions or otherwise operate its business; acts of terrorism or outbreak of war, hostilities, civil unrest, attacks against the Company or Pioneer, and other political or security disturbances; dilution caused by the Company&#8217;s issuance of additional shares of its common stock in connection with the Merger; the possibility that the transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; changes in policy and consumer support for emission-reduction products and technology; the impacts of pandemics or other public health crises, including the effects of government responses on people and economies; global or regional changes in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market or economic conditions that impact demand, prices and differentials, including reservoir performance; changes in technical or operating conditions, including unforeseen technical difficulties; those risks described in Item 1A of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2023, and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, as well as under the heading &#8220;Factors Affecting Future Results&#8221; on the Investors page of the Company&#8217;s website at www.exxonmobil.com (information included on or accessible through the Company&#8217;s website is not incorporated by reference into this communication); those risks described in Item 1A of Pioneer&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2023, and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K; and those risks described in the registration statement on Form S-4 and accompanying prospectus available from the sources indicated above. References to resources or other quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that the Company or Pioneer believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as &#8220;proved reserves&#8221; under SEC definitions.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

These risks, as well as other risks associated with the Merger, are more fully discussed in the proxy statement/prospectus included in the registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger. While the list of factors presented here and the list of factors presented in the registration statement on Form S-4 are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements as they are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes and that actual performance and outcomes, including, without limitation, our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of new markets or market segments in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this communication. Neither the Company nor Pioneer assumes any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws. Neither future distribution of this communication nor the continued availability of this communication in archive form on the Company&#8217;s or Pioneer&#8217;s website should be deemed to constitute an update or re-affirmation of these statements as of any future date.

&#160;

Actions needed to advance the Company&#8217;s 2030 and 2035 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company&#8217;s Energy Outlook research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment, the Energy Outlook does not attempt to project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or the Company, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and the Company&#8217;s business plans will be updated accordingly. Actual future results, including the achievement of net zero in Upstream Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030/2035 and plans to lower methane emissions from operated assets, to increase water recycling in our combined Permian operations, and to feed hydrogen, ammonia, and carbon capture projects could vary depending on the ability to execute operational objectives on a timely and successful basis; policy support for emission-reduction products and technologies; changes in laws, regulations and international treaties regarding lower emission technologies and projects; government incentives; unforeseen technical or operational difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects, technologies, and markets on a commercially competitive basis; changes in supply and demand and other market factors affecting future prices of oil, gas, and petrochemical products; the actions of competitors; and other factors discussed in this communication and in the additional forward looking statement disclaimer included above.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (the &#8220; Corporation &#8221;) provides the following disclosure in connection with the special meeting of stockholders of Denbury, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220; Denbury &#8221;), to be held on October 31, 2023 to vote on the acquisition of Denbury by the Corporation as more fully described in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus (as defined below) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220; SEC &#8221;), dated September 29, 2023, relating to such acquisition and special meeting.

Based on the exchange ratio of 0.840 of a share of ExxonMobil common stock, the $113.02 closing price per share of ExxonMobil common stock on October 19, 2023, and the amount of Denbury&#8217;s indebtedness currently expected to be outstanding at the closing of the merger, the transaction fee for each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and TPH&#38;Co. would be approximately $42.7 million (including the $3 million opinion fee which became payable to each of them upon delivery of their respective fairness opinion to the Denbury board of directors). As compensation for its services in connection with the merger, PJT Partners is entitled to receive from Denbury a fee of $3 million, which became payable upon the delivery of PJT Partners&#8217; opinion to the Denbury board of directors.

All such forward-looking statements are based upon current plans, estimates, expectations and ambitions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of the Corporation and Denbury, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, or at all, including obtaining regulatory approvals that may be required on anticipated terms and Denbury stockholder approval; anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the combined company&#8217;s operations and other conditions to the completion of the merger, including the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the ability of the Corporation and Denbury to integrate the business successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies and value creation; potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction that could be instituted against the Corporation, Denbury or their respective directors; the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm the Corporation&#8217;s or Denbury&#8217;s business, including current plans and operations and that management&#8217;s time and attention will be diverted on transaction-related issues; potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the merger; rating agency actions and the Corporation and Denbury&#8217;s ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; legislative, regulatory and economic developments, including regulatory implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, timely and attractive permitting for carbon capture and storage by applicable federal and state regulators, and other regulatory actions targeting public companies in the oil and gas industry and changes in local, national, or international laws, regulations, and policies affecting the Corporation and Denbury including with respect to the environment; potential business uncertainty, including the outcome of commercial negotiations and changes to existing business relationships during the pendency of the merger that could affect the Corporation&#8217;s and/or Denbury&#8217;s financial performance and operating results; certain restrictions during the pendency of the merger that may impact Denbury&#8217;s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions or otherwise operate its business; acts of terrorism or outbreak of war, hostilities, civil unrest, attacks against the Corporation or Denbury, and other political or security disturbances; dilution caused by the Corporation&#8217;s issuance of additional shares of its common stock in connection with the proposed transaction; the possibility that the transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; changes in policy and consumer support for emission-reduction products and technology; the impacts of pandemics or other public health crises, including the effects of government responses on people and

economies; global or regional changes in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market or economic conditions that impact demand, prices and differentials, including reservoir performance; changes in technical or operating conditions, including unforeseen technical difficulties; those risks described in Item 1A of the Corporation&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2023, and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, as well as under the heading &#8220;Factors Affecting Future Results&#8221; on the Investors page of the Corporation&#8217;s website at www.exxonmobil.com (information included on or accessible through the Corporation&#8217;s website is not incorporated by reference into this communication); those risks described in Item 1A of Denbury&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2023, and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K; and those risks described in the registration statement on Form S-4 and accompanying definitive proxy statement/prospectus available from the sources indicated above. References to resources or other quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that the Corporation or Denbury believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as &#8220;proved reserves&#8221; under SEC definitions.

These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed transaction, are more fully discussed in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus included in the registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC and mailed to Denbury stockholders in connection with the proposed transaction. While the list of factors presented here and the list of factors presented in the registration statement on Form S-4 and the definitive proxy statement/prospectus are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements as they are not guarantees of future performance or outcomes and that actual performance and outcomes, including, without limitation, our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of new markets or market segments in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this communication. Neither the Corporation nor Denbury assumes any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws. Neither future distribution of this communication nor the continued availability of this communication in archive form on the Corporation&#8217;s or Denbury&#8217;s website should be deemed to constitute an update or re-affirmation of these statements as of any future date."

Additionally, each share of restricted Pioneer common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will become fully vested, Pioneer will withhold a number of such shares necessary to satisfy any tax withholding, and the remainder of such shares will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Each Pioneer RSU granted on or after October 10, 2023 that is outstanding and remains unvested as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into a number of Company restricted stock units equal to the Merger Consideration, multiplied by the total number of shares of Pioneer common stock subject to such Pioneer RSU.

Forward-Looking Statements

In this context, forward-looking statements often address future business and financial events, conditions, expectations, plans or ambitions, and often contain words such as &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;see,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words, but not all forward-looking statements include such words. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. All such forward-looking statements are based upon current plans, estimates, expectations and ambitions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of ExxonMobil and Denbury, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, or at all, including obtaining regulatory approvals that may be required on anticipated terms and Denbury stockholder approval; anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the combined company&#8217;s operations and other conditions to the completion of the merger, including the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the ability of ExxonMobil and Denbury to integrate the business successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies and value creation; potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction that could be instituted against ExxonMobil, Denbury or their respective directors; the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm ExxonMobil&#8217;s or Denbury&#8217;s business, including current plans and operations and that management&#8217;s time and attention will be diverted on transaction-related issues; potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the merger; rating agency actions and ExxonMobil and Denbury&#8217;s ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; legislative, regulatory and economic developments, including regulatory implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, timely and attractive permitting for carbon capture and storage by applicable federal and state regulators, and other regulatory actions targeting public companies in the oil and gas industry and changes in local, national, or international laws, regulations, and policies affecting ExxonMobil and Denbury including with respect to the environment; potential business uncertainty, including the outcome of commercial negotiations and changes to existing business relationships during the pendency of the merger that could affect ExxonMobil&#8217;s and/or Denbury&#8217;s financial performance and operating results; certain restrictions during the pendency of the merger that may impact Denbury&#8217;s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions or otherwise operate its business; acts of terrorism or outbreak of war, hostilities, civil unrest, attacks against ExxonMobil or Denbury, and other political or security disturbances; dilution caused by ExxonMobil&#8217;s issuance of additional shares of its common stock in connection with the proposed transaction; the possibility that the transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; changes in policy and consumer support for emission-reduction products and technology; the impacts of pandemics or other public health crises, including the effects of government responses on people and economies; global or regional changes in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market or economic conditions that impact demand, prices and differentials, including reservoir performance; changes in technical or operating conditions, including unforeseen technical difficulties; those risks described in Item 1A of ExxonMobil&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2023, and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, as well as under the heading &#8220;Factors Affecting Future Results&#8221; on the Investors page of ExxonMobil&#8217;s website at www.exxonmobil.com (information included on or accessible through ExxonMobil&#8217;s website is not incorporated by reference into this communication); those risks described in Item 1A of Denbury&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2023, and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K; and those risks that will be described in the registration statement on Form S-4 and accompanying prospectus available from the sources indicated above. References to resources or other quantities of oil or natural gas may include amounts that ExxonMobil or Denbury believe will ultimately be produced, but that are not yet classified as &#8220;proved reserves&#8221; under SEC definitions.

&#160;

&#160;

These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed transaction, will be more fully discussed in the proxy statement/prospectus that will be included in the registration statement on Form S-4 that will be filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction.

As previously disclosed, on October 22, 2023, Chevron Corporation (&#8220; Chevron &#8221;), Hess Corporation (&#8220; Hess &#8221;) and Yankee Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron (&#8220; Merger Sub &#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8221;), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Hess, with Hess surviving the merger as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron (such transaction, the &#8220; Merger &#8221;). 

The consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions including, among other things, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the &#8220; HSR Act &#8221;). As previously disclosed, on December 7, 2023, Chevron and Hess each received a request for additional information and documentary material (the &#8220; Second Request &#8221;) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (&#8220; FTC &#8221;) in connection with the FTC&#8217;s review of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The effect of the Second Request was to extend the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both Chevron and Hess certified substantial compliance with the Second Request. Following Chevron&#8217;s and Hess&#8217;s certifications of substantial compliance, the waiting period under the HSR Act expired on July 1, 2024. 

On September 30, 2024, the FTC announced that a majority of the FTC Commissioners voted to accept a consent agreement among the FTC, Chevron and Hess (the &#8220; Consent Agreement &#8221;), and on September 30, 2024, Chevron issued a press release announcing that the FTC&#8217;s review of the Merger has been completed. A copy of the press release is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this current report on Form 8-K. Under the Consent Agreement, Chevron and Hess have agreed that John B. Hess will not be appointed to the Chevron Board of Directors following consummation of the Merger. Mr. Hess will serve as an advisor and representative for Chevron on government relations and social investments in Guyana, as well as on support for the Salk Institute&#8217;s Harnessing Plants Initiative. 

Pursuant to the regulations issued under the HSR Act, the parties have one year from the expiration of the waiting period to close the Merger. Chevron and Hess will take appropriate steps in order to maintain HSR clearance for the Merger closing following satisfactory resolution of the ongoing arbitration proceedings regarding preemptive rights in the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement, including if necessary filing additional notifications under the HSR Act. 

The completion of the Merger remains subject to the Merger Agreement&#8217;s closing conditions, including the satisfactory resolution of the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement arbitration."

On October 22, 2023, Chevron Corporation (&#8220; Chevron &#8221;) entered into a definitive merger agreement with Hess Corporation (&#8220; Hess &#8221;), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Chevron will be merged with and into Hess, with Hess continuing as the surviving corporation of such merger and as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron (such transaction, the &#8220; Merger &#8221;) .

Hess Guyana Exploration Limited (&#8220; HGEL &#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hess, is currently in arbitration with respect to the right of first refusal (the &#8220; Stabroek ROFR &#8221;) contained in an operating agreement among HGEL and affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation (&#8220; Exxon &#8221;) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (&#8220; CNOOC &#8221;) regarding the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana.

The arbitration merits hearing about the applicability of the Stabroek ROFR to the Merger has been scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected in the following three months. Chevron and Hess had expected and requested that this hearing be held earlier, but the arbitrators&#8217; common schedules did not make this possible.

The views of Chevron and Hess on the merits remain unchanged. Exxon and CNOOC continue to ignore the plain language of the operating agreement, and Chevron and Hess remain confident that the arbitration will confirm that the Stabroek ROFR does not apply to the Merger.

Chevron and Hess remain committed to the Merger and look forward to combining the two companies.

2024 Executive Compensation Review and 2024 Base Salaries 

On January 31, 2024, the independent Directors of the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) of Chevron Corporation (&#8220;Chevron&#8221;) conducted an annual review of the compensation of Chevron&#8217;s executive officers, including Michael K. Wirth, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;); Pierre R. Breber, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and the other named executive officers of Chevron identified in Chevron&#8217;s 2023 proxy statement who are currently employed by Chevron, Mark A. Nelson, Vice Chairman; and R. Hewitt Pate, Vice President and General Counsel (collectively, the &#8220;Named Executive Officers&#8221;). Following such review, the independent Directors of the Board approved an annual base salary of $1,900,000 for Mr. Wirth, an increase of $50,000, and ratified the decision of the Management Compensation Committee of the Board (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) to increase the annual base salaries of the principal financial officer and the other Named Executive Officers, as follows: (i) no change to Mr. Breber&#8217;s annual base salary of $1,150,000 in anticipation of his expected retirement; (ii) an increase of $75,000 for Mr. Nelson, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,275,000; and (iii) an increase of $50,000 for Mr. Pate, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,150,000. All base salary increases will be effective March 1, 2024. 

Chevron Incentive Plan 

On January 31, 2024, the independent Directors of the Board approved no change to the 2024 target percentage under the Chevron Incentive Plan (&#8220;CIP&#8221;) for Mr. Wirth (165 percent) and ratified the decision of the Committee to make no changes to the target bonus percentages for 2024 under the CIP for Messrs. Breber (110 percent), Nelson (120 percent), and Pate (110 percent). 

2024 Equity Awards to Named Executive Officers 

On January 31, 2024, the independent Directors of the Board also approved the equity grant target value of $17,500,000 to Mr. Wirth and ratified the following equity grant target values by the Committee under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan of Chevron Corporation (&#8220;2022 LTIP&#8221;), with an award grant date of February 6, 2024 (the &#8220;Grant Date&#8221;): (i) Mr. Nelson, $5,593,500; and (ii) Mr. Pate, $4,286,100. Mr. Breber will not receive an equity grant due to his upcoming retirement from Chevron. Each 2024 award under the 2022 LTIP comprises three equity vehicles: performance shares (50%), restricted stock units (25%), and stock options (25%). The actual number of performance shares and standard restricted stock units to be granted to each of Messrs. Wirth, Nelson, and Pate will be determined by dividing the target value of each equity vehicle by the closing price of Chevron&#8217;s common stock on the Grant Date. The actual number of stock options granted to each of Messrs. Wirth, Nelson, and Pate will be determined based on the Black-Scholes value of a stock option on the Grant Date. 

The stock options have a ten-year term, and vest one-third ratably on each of February 10, 2025, February 10, 2026, and February 10, 2027, except as described further herein. The exercise price for the stock options will be equal to the closing price of Chevron&#8217;s common stock on the Grant Date. 

The standard restricted stock units awarded vest one-third ratably on each of February 10, 2025, February 10, 2026, and February 10, 2027 and will settle in shares of Chevron common stock, with value based on the closing price of Chevron common stock on the vesting date (or, if not a trading day, on the last preceding trading day), and will accrue dividend equivalents in the form of additional restricted stock units, except as described further herein. The restricted stock unit award payout is subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period for executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers. 

The performance shares may result in a payout at the end of the three-year performance period (January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026) (the &#8220;Performance Period&#8221;) depending upon Chevron&#8217;s relative performance, weighted 70 percent based on relative Total Shareholder Return (&#8220;TSR&#8221;) as measured against the large-cap integrated energy companies BP p.l.c., ExxonMobil Corporation, Shell p.l.c., and TotalEnergies SE (collectively, the &#8220;LTIP Performance Share Peer Group&#8221;), and the S&#38;P 500 Total Return Index (&#8220;S&#38;P 500 Index""); and 30 percent based on relative Return on Capital Employed (&#8220;ROCE&#8221;) Improvement as measured against the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group, as follows:

The TSR Modifier is based on Chevron&#8217;s TSR ranking for the three-year Performance Period compared to the TSR of each competitor in the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group and the S&#38;P 500 Index (from best TSR to lowest TSR) as set forth in the table. In the event Chevron&#8217;s measured TSR is less than 1 percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) of the nearest member(s) of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group and the S&#38;P 500 Index, the results will be considered a tie, and the TSR Modifier will be determined by averaging the TSR Modifiers in the tied positions. In the event of negative TSR for the Performance Period, any above-target TSR Modifier will be reduced by 20 percent for executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers. 

2. Chevron&#8217;s ROCE Improvement (&#8220;ROCE-I&#8221;), measured by percentage point change, as compared with the ROCE-I for the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group. The ROCE-I Modifier is based on Chevron&#8217;s ROCE-I ranking for the three-year period commencing with the quarter preceding the beginning of the Performance Period and ending one quarter prior to the end of the Performance Period, compared to the ROCE-I of each company in the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group (from best ROCE-I to lowest ROCE-I) as set forth in the table. In the event Chevron&#8217;s measured ROCE-I is less than one half of a percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) of the nearest member(s) of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group, the results will be considered a tie, and the ROCE-I Modifier will be determined by dividing the sum of the ROCE-I Modifiers in the tied positions by the number of members of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group in the tie. 

The performance shares will accrue dividend equivalents in the form of additional performance shares and will vest on December 31, 2026, subject to the payout modifiers, except as described further herein. The payout, if any, will be based on the number of performance shares vested, including dividend equivalents; multiplied by a performance share multiplier, which is the sum of the weighted TSR Modifier and the weighted ROCE-I Modifier, each of which is determined as described above and rounded to the nearest whole percentage; then multiplied by the closing price of Chevron&#8217;s common stock as of the certification date of the performance share multiplier by the Committee. The Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the payout of performance shares downward if it determines that business or economic considerations warrant such an adjustment. Effective for performance share awards granted in 2024, payout will be in shares of Chevron common stock. 

Under the 2022 LTIP award terms, if these individuals&#8217; employment terminates for any reason prior to February 10, 2025, the above-described stock option, restricted stock unit, and performance share awards will be forfeited. Since Messrs. Wirth, Nelson, and Pate each have reached 90 points under the 2022 LTIP rules (for Messrs. Wirth and Nelson, the sum of years of age and years of service; and for Mr. Pate, pursuant to the terms of an agreement relating solely to the vesting of his outstanding equity awards), on February 10, 2025, 100 percent of the unvested portion of the above-described stock options will vest upon the termination of their employment on or after that date for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the 2022 LTIP rules), and such options will be exercisable through the remainder of the original 10-year term. In addition, 100 percent of the unvested portion of the above-described standard restricted stock unit awards will continue to vest upon the termination of their employment on or after February 10, 2025, for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the 2022 LTIP rules) but will not be vested and paid out until the respective original vest date of February 10, 2026 or February 10, 2027, as applicable. Upon termination of employment, the post-vesting holding period for the restricted stock unit payout will be removed. Further, 100 percent of the unvested portion of the above-described performance share awards will continue to vest upon the termination of their employment on or after February 10, 2025, for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined in the 2022 LTIP rules) but will not be fully vested and will not be paid out prior to December 31, 2026. 

Effective January 30, 2024, the Committee approved new forms of award agreements to be used for the award of performance shares, stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock units under the 2022 LTIP on a going-forward basis to executive officers and other eligible employees of Chevron, including the awards to the Named Executive Officers described above. Copies of such forms of award agreements are filed as exhibits hereto and are hereby incorporated by reference herein."

On February 2, 2024 , Chevron Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) issued a news release announcing unaudited fourth quarter 2023 earnings of $2.3 billion. The news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. 

The information included herein and in Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed &#8220;filed&#8221; for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended."

On January 2, 2024, Chevron Corporation announced that for fourth quarter 2023, the Company will be impairing a portion of its U.S. upstream assets, primarily in California, due to continuing regulatory challenges in the state that have resulted in lower anticipated future investment levels in its business plans. The Company expects to continue operating the impacted assets for many years to come. In addition, the Company will be recognizing a loss related to abandonment and decommissioning obligations from previously sold oil and gas production assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as companies that purchased these assets have filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and we believe it is now probable and estimable that a portion of these obligations will revert to the Company. We expect to undertake the decommissioning activities on these assets over the next decade. 

The Company is in the process of finalizing the financial impacts of these actions, which it expects to treat as special items and exclude from adjusted earnings. These actions in the aggregate are currently estimated to result in non-cash, after-tax charges of $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion in the Company&#8217;s fourth quarter 2023 results. 

As used in this communication, terms such as &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;its&#8221; and ""our"" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or to all of them taken as a whole. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures - This communication includes reference to adjusted earnings/(loss), which reflect earnings or losses excluding significant non-operational items including impairment charges, write-offs, severance costs, gains on asset sales, unusual tax items, effects of pension settlements and curtailments, foreign currency effects and other special items. We believe it is useful for investors to consider adjusted earnings in comparing the underlying performance of our business across periods. This additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

As previously disclosed, on October 22, 2023, Chevron Corporation (&#8220; Chevron &#8221;) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8221;) with Hess Corporation (&#8220; Hess &#8221;) and Yankee Merger Sub Inc., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron (&#8220; Merger Subsidiary &#8221;). The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Hess, with Hess surviving and continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger and as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron (such transaction, the &#8220; Merger &#8221;). 

The Merger is conditioned on, among other things, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the &#8220; HSR Act &#8221;). Pursuant to the HSR Act, Hess and Chevron filed notification and report forms with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220; FTC &#8221;).

On December 7, 2023, Chevron and Hess each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (the &#8220; Second Request &#8221;) from the FTC in connection with the FTC&#8217;s review of the Merger. Issuance of the Second Request extends the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after Chevron and Hess have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by Chevron and Hess or terminated sooner by the FTC. Both Chevron and Hess expect to promptly respond to the Second Request and to continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the Merger.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On October 22, 2023, Chevron Corporation (&#8220; Chevron &#8221;) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8221;) with Hess Corporation (&#8220; Hess &#8221;) and Yankee Merger Sub Inc., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron (&#8220; Merger Subsidiary &#8221;). The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Hess, with Hess surviving and continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger and as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron (such transaction, the &#8220; Merger &#8221;).

At the effective time of the Merger (the &#8220; Effective Time &#8221;), each outstanding share of common stock of Hess, par value $1.00 per share (the &#8220; Hess Common Stock &#8221;), will be converted into the right to receive 1.025 (the &#8220; Exchange Ratio &#8221;) shares of common stock of Chevron, par value $0.75 per share (&#8220; Chevron Common Stock &#8221;), plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Chevron Common Stock that otherwise would have been issued (the &#8220; Merger Consideration &#8221;).

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, (i) each then outstanding Hess stock option and restricted stock award and each then outstanding performance share unit (&#8220; PSU &#8221;) award granted on or after the date of the Merger Agreement will be converted into corresponding Chevron equity awards based on the Exchange Ratio, subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such awards immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that any performance conditions applicable to such PSU award will be deemed to be achieved at the target level as of the Effective Time) and (ii) each then outstanding PSU award granted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement will be deemed to be earned at the maximum level and converted into a restricted cash award in an amount per PSU award equal to the average closing trading price of a share of Chevron Common Stock for the 20 business days ending on and including the second to last business day prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and in each case shall remain subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to such awards immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the performance conditions).

The board of directors of Hess has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and resolved to recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Hess stockholders, who will be asked to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at a stockholders meeting. The board of directors of Chevron also unanimously approved the Merger Agreement.

The completion of the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary mutual closing conditions, including (1) the receipt of the required approval from Hess stockholders, (2) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the &#8220; HSR Act &#8221;), (3) the absence of any order or law prohibiting consummation of the Merger, (4) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Chevron pursuant to which the shares of Chevron Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220; SEC &#8221;), and (5) the authorization for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the shares of Chevron Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement and the other party&#8217;s representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement being true and correct (subject to certain materiality qualifiers).

The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of Chevron and Hess relating to their respective businesses, financial statements and public filings, in each case generally subject to customary materiality qualifiers. Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides for customary pre-closing covenants of Hess and Chevron, including a covenant of Hess relating to using all reasonable best efforts to conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to certain exceptions, and covenants of each party to refrain from taking certain actions without the other party&#8217;s consent. Hess and Chevron also agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated, to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust laws or other applicable laws, and to obtain expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, subject to certain exceptions.

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

The Merger Agreement provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of the Merger Agreement, Hess is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties, provide non-public information to third parties and engage in negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions.

The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for each of Hess and Chevron, including, among others, (1) if the consummation of the Merger does not occur on or before April 18, 2024 (the &#8220; End Date &#8221;); except that the End Date will automatically be successively extended to October 22, 2024, April 22, 2025 and October 22, 2025 if all required applicable regulatory approvals have not been obtained by what would otherwise be the End Date but all other conditions to closing have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied) or (to the extent permitted by law) waived; and (2) subject to certain conditions, if Hess desires to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement). Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including the termination by Chevron in the event of a change of recommendation by the board of directors of Hess or by Hess in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, Hess would be required to pay Chevron a termination fee of $1,715,000,000.

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby in this Current Report on Form 8-K is only a summary and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The parties expect to file the registration statement on Form S-4 containing Chevron&#8217;s preliminary prospectus and Hess&#8217;s preliminary proxy statement as promptly as practicable.

The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Hess or Chevron. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement as of the specific dates therein, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Hess&#8217;s or Chevron&#8217;s public disclosures."

Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the consummation of the potential transaction, including the expected time period to consummate the potential transaction, and the anticipated benefits (including synergies) of the potential transaction. All such forward-looking statements are based upon current plans, estimates, expectations and ambitions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of Chevron and Hess, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to the risk that regulatory approvals are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated by Chevron and Hess; potential delays in consummating the potential transaction, including as a result of regulatory approvals; Chevron&#8217;s ability to integrate Hess&#8217; operations in a successful manner and in the expected time period; the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits and projected synergies of the potential transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; risks that the anticipated tax treatment of the potential transaction is not obtained; unforeseen or unknown liabilities; customer, shareholder, regulatory and other stakeholder approvals and support; unexpected future capital expenditures; potential litigation relating to the potential transaction that could be instituted against Chevron and Hess or their respective directors; the possibility that the transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; the effect of the announcement, pendency or completion of the potential transaction on the parties&#8217; business relationships and business generally; risks that the potential transaction disrupts current plans and operations of Chevron or Hess and potential difficulties in Hess employee retention as a result of the transaction, as well as the risk of disruption of Chevron&#8217;s or Hess&#8217; management and business disruption during the pendency of, or following, the potential transaction; the receipt of required Chevron Board of Directors&#8217; authorizations to implement capital allocation strategies, including future dividend payments; uncertainties as to whether the potential transaction will be consummated on the anticipated timing or at all, or if consummated, will achieve its anticipated economic benefits, including as a result of risks associated with third party contracts containing material consent, anti-assignment, transfer or other provisions that may be related to the potential transaction which are not waived or otherwise satisfactorily resolved; changes in commodity prices; negative effects of this announcement, and the pendency or completion of the proposed acquisition on the market price of Chevron&#8217;s or Hess&#8217; common stock and/or operating results; rating agency actions and Chevron&#8217;s and Hess&#8217; ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; various events that could disrupt operations, including severe weather, such as droughts, floods, avalanches and earthquakes, and cybersecurity attacks, as well as security threats and governmental response to them, and technological changes; labor disputes; changes in labor costs and labor difficulties; the effects of industry, market, economic, political or regulatory conditions outside of Chevron&#8217;s or Hess&#8217; control; legislative, regulatory and economic developments targeting public companies in the oil and gas industry; and the risks described in Part I, Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of (i) Chevron&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and (ii) Hess&#8217; Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and, in each case, in subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;).

2023 Executive Compensation Review and 2023 Base Salarie s 

On January 25, 2023, the independent Directors of the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) of Chevron Corporation (&#8220;Chevron&#8221;) conducted an annual review of the compensation of Chevron&#8217;s executive officers, including Michael K. Wirth, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;); Pierre R. Breber, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and the other named executive officers of Chevron identified in Chevron&#8217;s 2022 proxy statement, James W. Johnson, Executive Vice President, Senior Advisor; and Mark A. Nelson, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Policy and Development (collectively, the &#8220;Named Executive Officers&#8221;). Following such review, the independent Directors of the Board approved an annual base salary of $1,850,000 for Mr. Wirth, an increase of $150,000, and ratified the decision of the Management Compensation Committee of the Board (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) to increase the annual base salaries of the principal financial officer and the other Named Executive Officers, as follows: (i) an increase of $75,000 for Mr. Breber, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,150,000; (ii) no change to Mr. Johnson&#8217;s annual base salary at $1,250,000; and (iii) an increase of $100,000 for Mr. Nelson, resulting in an annual base salary of $1,200,000 due to his election by the Board to a new corporate officer role, Vice Chairman, in addition to Executive Vice President, Strategy, Policy and Development, effective February 1, 2023. All other base salary increases will be effective March 1, 2023. 

Chevron Incentive Plan 

On January 25, 2023, the independent Directors of the Board approved no change to the bonus target of 165 percent for 2023 under the Chevron Incentive Plan (&#8220;CIP&#8221;) for Michael K. Wirth, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and ratified the decision of the Committee to set the target bonus percentages for 2023 under the CIP for the other Named Executive Officers, as follows: (i) Mr. Breber at 110 percent (no change from 2022); and (ii) Mr. Nelson at 120 percent, an increase from 110 percent in 2022 in connection with his new corporate officer role. Mr. Johnson will not receive a CIP award for the 2023 performance cycle due to his upcoming separation from Chevron. 

2023 Equity Awards to Named Executive Officers 

On January 25, 2023, the independent Directors of the Board also approved the grant of 47,460 performance shares, 92,800 stock options, and 23,730 standard restricted stock units to Mr. Wirth and ratified the following grants by the Committee under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan of Chevron Corporation (&#8220;2022 LTIP&#8221;): (i) Mr. Breber, 11,790 performance shares, 23,000 stock options, and 5,900 standard restricted stock units; and (ii) Mr. Nelson, 15,390 performance shares, 30,100 stock options, and 7,700 standard restricted stock units. Mr. Johnson did not receive an equity grant due to his upcoming separation from Chevron. 

The stock options have a ten-year term, and one-third of the options granted vest on each of January 31, 2024, January 31, 2025, and January 31, 2026, except as described further herein. The exercise price for the stock options is $179.08 per share, the closing price of Chevron&#8217;s common stock on January 25, 2023, the date of grant. The number of stock options granted was determined based on grant date inputs, including stock price and Black-Scholes valuation. 

The standard restricted stock units awarded vest one-third ratably on each of January 31, 2024, January 31, 2025, and January 31, 2026, and will settle in shares of Chevron common stock based on the date of vesting (or, if not a trading day, on the last preceding trading day), and will accrue dividend equivalents that will be reinvested as additional restricted stock units, except as described further herein. The restricted stock units payout is subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period for executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers. 

The performance shares may result in a cash payout at the end of the three-year performance period (January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025) (the &#8220;Performance Period&#8221;) depending upon Chevron&#8217;s relative performance, weighted 70 percent based on relative Total Shareholder Return (&#8220;TSR&#8221;) as measured against BP p.l.c., ExxonMobil Corporation, Shell p.l.c., TotalEnergies SE, and the S&#38;P 500 Total Return Index (collectively, the &#8220;LTIP Performance Share Peer Group&#8221;), and 30 percent based on relative Return on Capital Employed (&#8220;ROCE&#8221;) Improvement as measured against the large-cap integrated energy companies BP p.l.c., ExxonMobil Corporation, Shell p.l.c., and TotalEnergies SE (collectively, the &#8220;ROCE Competitor Group&#8221;), as follows: 

Relative ranking 1 2 3 4 5 6 

TSR Modifier (1) 

(70% weight, ranking includes S&#38;P 500 Total Return Index) 

200% 160% 120% 80% 40% 0% 

ROCE Improvement Modifier (2) 

(30% weight, ranking excludes S&#38;P 500 Total Return Index) 

200% 150% 100% 50% 0% n/a 

1. Chevron&#8217;s TSR for the Performance Period as compared to the TSR of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group. The TSR Modifier is based on Chevron&#8217;s TSR ranking for the three-year Performance Period compared to the TSR of each competitor in the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group (from best TSR to lowest TSR) as set forth in the table. In the event Chevron&#8217;s measured TSR is less than 1 percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) of the nearest member(s) of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group, the results will be considered a tie, and the TSR Modifier will be determined by dividing the sum of the TSR Modifiers in the tied positions by the number of members of the LTIP Performance Share Peer Group in the tie. In the event of negative TSR for the Performance Period, any above-target TSR Modifier will be reduced by 20 percent for executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers. 

2. Chevron&#8217;s ROCE Improvement (&#8220;ROCE-I&#8221;), measured by percentage point change, as compared with the ROCE-I for the ROCE Competitor Group. The ROCE-I Modifier is based on Chevron&#8217;s ROCE-I ranking for the three-year period commencing with the quarter preceding the beginning of the Performance Period and ending one quarter prior to the end of the Performance Period, compared to the ROCE-I of each company in the ROCE Competitor Group (from best ROCE-I to lowest ROCE-I) as set forth in the table. In the event Chevron&#8217;s measured ROCE-I is less than one half of a percentage point (rounded to one decimal point) of the nearest member(s) of the ROCE Competitor Group, the results will be considered a tie, and the ROCE-I Modifier will be determined by dividing the sum of the ROCE-I Modifiers in the tied positions by the number of members of the ROCE Competitor Group in the tie. 

The performance shares will accrue dividend equivalents that will be reinvested as additional performance shares and will vest on December 31, 2025, subject to the payout modifiers, except as described further herein. The cash payout, if any, will occur in an amount equal to the number of performance shares granted, including dividend equivalents, multiplied by the 20-day trailing average price of Chevron common stock at the end of the Performance Period, multiplied by a performance share multiplier, which is the weighted average of (a) the TSR Modifier (70 percent weight); and (b) the ROCE-I Modifier (30 percent weight), each of which is determined as described above. The Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the cash payout of performance shares downward if it determines that business or economic considerations warrant such an adjustment. 

Under the 2022 LTIP award terms, if these individuals&#8217; employment terminates for any reason prior to January 31, 2024, the above-described stock option, restricted stock unit, and performance share awards will be forfeited. Since Messrs. Wirth, Breber and Nelson each have reached 90 points (the sum of years of age and years of service) under the 2022 LTIP rules, on January 31, 2024, 100 percent of the unvested portion of the above-described stock options will vest upon the termination of their employment on or after that date for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the 2022 LTIP rules), and such options will be exercisable through the remainder of the original 10-year term. In addition, 100 percent of the unvested portion of the above-described standard restricted stock unit awards will continue to vest upon the termination of their employment on or after January 31, 2024, for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined under the 2022 LTIP rules) but will not be vested and paid out until the respective original vest date of January 31, 2025, or January 31, 2026. Upon termination of employment, the post-vesting holding period for the restricted stock units payout shall be removed. Further, 100 percent of the unvested portion of the above-described performance share awards will continue to vest upon the termination of their employment on or after January 31, 2024, for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined in the 2022 LTIP rules) but will not be fully vested and will not be paid out prior to December 31, 2025. 

Effective January 24, 2023, the Committee approved forms of award agreements to be used for the award of performance shares, stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock units under the 2022 LTIP on a going-forward basis to executive officers and other eligible employees of Chevron, including the awards to the Named Executive Officers described above. Copies of such forms of award agreements are filed as exhibits hereto and are hereby incorporated by reference herein."

On January 25, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of the Company&#8217;s shares of common stock in an aggregate amount of $75 billion .

The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the Company &#8217; s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time."
